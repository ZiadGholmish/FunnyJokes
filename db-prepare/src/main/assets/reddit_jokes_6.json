The principal told Ms. Brooks he would give the boy a test. If he failed to answer any of his questions he was to go back to the 1st grade and behave.

But I think the current political climate allows me to rehash it better. \n\nEnrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who is the Mexican President, is walking along the beach one day with the US President, Donald Trump, and prominent middle eastern human rights activist Malala Yousafzai. \n\nThey happen to come across a lamp, and of course what anyone does when they discover a random lamp, they each give it a good rub and out pops an all-powerful genie. \n\n\"3 Of you have awoken me! But I have only 3 wishes to give!\" Shouts the Genie. \"I will give each of you 1 wish, choose wisely!\"\n\nEnrique speaks up first, \"Oh magical Genie! I'd like Mexico to become a wealthy and strong nation! I want to be able to provide for our people and keep them safe from the Cartels! I want the economy in our country to be strong enough that families need not leave in order to find jobs. I want Mexican culture to flourish such that people are proud to be Mexican and can come home and celebrate with all of their friends and family!\"\n\n*Poof* - and just like that, the Mexican Peso surges past the US Dollar, and all the Mexican immigrants in America are rushing back to Mexico to work more lucrative jobs. Even now in fact, some Americans are illegally crossing the border trying to get jobs in the new world economic superpower. \n\nMalala goes next. \"Genie, please! I wish that there was peace in the middle east! That all of Pakistan, India, Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya... All of it! I wish that everyone could come to their senses and stop fighting for power, and instead work towards bettering their own societies. Education and equality for all, men, women, and children! Allow those of any  faith, be that Muslim, Jew, Hindu, Christian, Buddhist, whatever they wish to believe - allow them to live harmoniously together and bring about a peaceful revolution to world. \n\n*Poof* - and just like that, all across the middle east a sense of calm crosses the land. People set aside their differences and come to understand one another. New glorious Multi-faith temples arise that attract pilgrims and tourists, and Schools and Universities spring up all over - creating a new intellectual hub of the world. People from all over are trying to get into these prestigious schools to learn from the greatest minds, and this open and safe mix of cultures creates a near utopia like region of the globe.\n\nLast is Donald Trump. As he's checking his twitter and other online news feeds, he sees that America has fallen from great heights. All of the low-income workforce has left the country, and those with the means to leave the country have done so to move on to greener pastures. What's left is a mess of those too impoverished to leave or too proud or uneducated to see why they should.\n\nDonald Trump takes a look at all of this, then turns to the genie and says, \"Well, so long as the Mexicans and Muslims are gone, I'll just take a Pepsi.\" ",

Well Miss, we were out for a stroll in the forest and suddenly a thunderstorm came up and the lightning struck several trees, and that's what these jagged lines are.

Satisfied with that answer, the little kid decides to ask his dad what a \"Penis\" is.

Almost instantly, he returns in a huge flock of bats. His hands are covered in blood.\n\nWith a cackle, he points down the road.\n\n\"You see that abandoned coach down there? I slaughtered everyone in it! The driver, a nobleman and his wife, their three sons, and a guardsman! All dead in the blink of an eye!\"\n\nThe second, older than the first, but younger than the last, scoffs. \"Child's play. Watch this.\" And disappears with the wind. Even with his heightened senses, the younger could not follow his movements.\n\nThe second vampire reappeared as suddenly as he had vanished, and the gust of his speed knocked the youngest to the ground. His hands, mouth, and collar were caked with gore. He gestures towards a town in the distance. As the vampires watched, a building lit on fire, and fell onto another one. Soon, the entire town was alight, but no movement could be seen from the townsfolk at all.\n\n\"A hundred people in that town! All dead! Torn to shreds!\"\n\nThe youngest was in awe, but the eldest of the three only chuckled amusedly.\n\n\"How cute.\" He says.\n\nThe second looks almost indignant. \"I'd like to see you do better.\"\n\nThe third lets out a malevolent chuckle.\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\nHe gets up, dusts off his cloak, and puts his spectacles down on a rock.\n\nHe disappears with a **CRACK.** The other two vampires' jaws dropped at the impossible speed that the eldest flew at.\n\nAnother resounding **CRACK** filled the air as the eldest vampire returned to the cave. His cloak was in tatters. His clothes were disheveled. But most prominent was the blood. His entire body was covered in blood. Never would the other vampires imagine that so much blood could cling to one person.\n\nThe eldest lets out a sigh, and plops to the ground. He reaches for his glasses, and cleans them with what remains of his cloak.\n\nThe younger vampires look at each other, not sure whether to break the silence.\n\nFinally, the youngest asks, \"So...?\"\n\nThe elder vampire looks up slowly. He murmurs,\n\n\"You see that massive tree over there? The one with the widest trunk, as thick as a man is tall?\"\n\nBaffled, the youngest replied, \"...Yes?\"\n\nThe eldest, sheepishly, continued.\n\n\"Well, I didn't.\"",

The elephant seemed distressed, so Peter approached it very carefully. He got down on one knee, inspected the elephants foot and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it. As carefully and as gently as he could, Peter worked the wood out with his knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot.\n\nThe elephant turned to face the man and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. Peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned and walked away. Peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.\n\nTwenty years later, Peter was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenaged son. As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Peter and his son Cameron were standing. The large bull elephant stared at Peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.\n\nRemembering the encounter in 1986, Peter could not help wondering if this was the same elephant. Peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing, and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Peter's legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly.\n\nI guess it wasn't the same elephant.",

If you so much as lay a finger on my daughter I will inflict upon you the three worst Chinese tortures known to man.\" \"OK,\" said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old as well, and entered the house. Before dinner the daughter came down the stairs. She was young, beautiful and had a fantastic figure. She was obviously attracted to the young man as she couldn't keep her eyes off him during the meal. Remembering the old man's warning he ignored her and went up to bed alone. But during the night he could bear it no longer and snuck into her room for a night of passion. He was careful to keep everything quiet so the old man wouldn't hear and, near dawn, he crept back to his room, exhausted but happy. He woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, \"Chinese Torture 1: Large rock on chest.\" \"Well, that's pretty crappy,\" he thought. \"If that's the best the old man can do then I don't have much to worry about.\" He picked the boulder up, walked over to the window and threw the boulder out. As he did so he noticed another note on it that read \"Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle.\" In a panic he glanced down and saw the line that was already getting close to taut. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder. As he plummeted downward he saw a large sign on the ground that read, \"Chinese Torture 3: Right testicle tied to bedpost\"",

The tribesmen bring the horse and the cowboy again whispers something into the horse's ear. The horse takes off and arrives back that night with a beautiful red-head on its back.

Choose wisely. You may yet redeem yourself.\"\n\nWithout hesitation, the cowboy asks for his horse one more time.

I know that you brought all those rich kids from school plenty of fancy toys last year, but I don't care for these. However, I wish you could bring me a hat, a scarf and a pair of gloves, so I could go out and play with my friends in the snow. That would be the most beautiful day of my life. With love, Johnny\".\nA post office employee intercepts the letter, reads if, and is moved by the little kid's story. She decides to go around the office and collect some money to buy little Johnny the gift he's been dreaming of.\nAfter chasing everyone in the office, she manages to gather $13... $14... $15. After work, she goes to a little shop nearby to buy the hat, scarf and gloves. Unfortunately, she only has enough money for a hat and a scarf. Oh well, that should do just fine. She wraps the gift, attaches a letter with it \"Dear Johnny, here is the gift you've asked me for. Enjoy the company of your friends on this very special day. Your friend, Santa\", and sends it to the kid. She feels great - a little kid's dream has been achieved thanks to her and her colleagues from the post office.\nOne week later, she intercepts another letter from the kid addressed to Santa, and is excited to read about the kid's wonderful Christmas Day: \"Dear Santa. I received your gift, thank you very much. Unfortunately, I couldn't go out and play with my friends and had to stay home with my mom (she gets pretty mean after two bottles of wine), because there were only a hat and a scarf in the box (no gloves), and my mom wouldn't let me go out without a pair of gloves.

It was a great game, but unfortunately ended in a draw. We took a taxi back to the hotel, but on the way I started to feel funny. I had some pains in my chest and felt short of breath. I chalked it up to the long day I had just had, but I continued to feel worse. As we got out of the taxi and walked into the hotel, I collapsed. It became apparent to my wife and I that I was having a heart attack! I thought for sure I would die because the nearest hospital was 1/2 hour away. Suddenly from the back room came a woman wielding defibrillators. She shouted to the other staff to help and they ripped off my shirt and restarted my heart right there in the hotel! The ambulance arrived 20 minutes later, but thanks to this amazing woman my life had been saved. I spent the night in the hospital but I got out around noon the next day. I went back to the hotel to thank this woman.

Joe for short. \n\nJoe was working away, about 15 minutes from clocking out, and heard a voice in his head that said, \"Quit your job, sell your house, go to Vegas.\" Joe just thought he overheard a conversation and continued throughout his day. \n\nAbout 2 months later, Joe was at home reading the newspaper after an average day of work, and then again he heard, \"Quit your job, sell your house, go to Vegas.\" This time joe seemed to be puzzled as the tv nor the radio was on. But he shrugged it off and continued to read.\n\nAbout 3 weeks later, Joe was on a date with Average Jill if you will. Jill was ordering a steak medium rare when suddenly, Joe heard the voice again say \"Quit your job, sell your house, go to Vegas.\" He asked Jill to be excused, and while in bathroom he rinsed his face with cold water. He was thinking to himself he must be going crazy. But again Joe continued on with his evening. \n\nIt wasn't 3 days before Joe heard the voice again repeat itself about every hour of the day. Then it would become every minute as the day grew dark, and it was starting to drive Joe mad. Joe drank himself to sleep that night. When Joe arose, he headed straight to work, asked his boss for his advance, and then quit immediately . The voices were still constantly repeating \"Quit your job, sell your house, go to Vegas.\" He then headed straight to the bank and took out all his savings. After he sold his house to the highest bidder. He loaded up his car with food and clothes, and the $235,000 he had tallied up, and set his TomTom for the nearest airport to go to Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nThe whole trip the voice constantly repeated itself, but as soon as he arrived in Las Vegas, the voice stopped. There was silence, something Joe treasured at the moment. He cracked a smile, but after about 5 solid blissful minutes, the voice began to say, \"Go to the nearest casino,\" over and over again. Felling forced to do so, he headed to the first casino he could find, with his $235k. As soon as he stepped in the casino, he heard the voice say, \"Cash in all your money for chips.\" This strange voice was actually starting to build up confidence in Joe. He thought to himself, if this voice has been in his head and got him this far, then it must know what it's doing. \n\nHis chin was high as he cashed in his entire life into those gorgeous chips in Vegas. Once he had his chips the voice says, \"Go to the third roulette table in the back left of the casino.\" Not even being able to see back that far, Joe listened. Sure enough there were 6 roulette tables exactly where the said, and Joe made his way to third table. The voice then said the instant Joe approached the table, \"Put all your money on Red 6.\" Without hesitation, Joe put his entire life on Red 6, $235k. The roulette table then spun, and then the ball was dropped. It bounced around as the roulette kept spinning, then suddenly it began to lose speed. The ball settled into its hole, but the numbers were too hard to read because of the speed of the spin. Then you hear the dealer call out, \"Loser! It landed on Black 13.\"\nJoe was devastated, and then the voice suddenly said in a surprised yet disappointed tone,\".....Fuck.\"",

There was much squawking and many feathers flying, till Henry had finished having his way with each hen. But Henry didn't stop there, he went in to the barn and mounted all the horses, one by one and still at the same frantic pace. Then he went to the pig house where he did the same.\nThe farmer, watching all of this with disbelief, cried out, \"Stop, Henry, you'll kill yourself.\" But Henry continued, seeking out each farm animal in the same manner.\nWell the next morning, the farmer looked out and saw Henry lying there on his lawn. His legs were up in the air, his eyes rolled back, and his long tongue hanging out. A buzzard was already circling above Henry.\nThe farmer walked up to Henry saying, \"Oh you poor thing, look what you did, you've gone and killed yourself.

The Territory Government then hired an Ornithological Behaviourist to determine the disproportionate percentages for truck versus car kills.\n\nAfter 18 months of research and $2.7 million spent, the Ornithological Behaviourist determined the cause in the deaths. When crows eat road kill, they always set-up a look-out crow in a nearby tree to warn of impending danger. His conclusion was that the lookout crow could say \u201cCah\u201d, but he could not say \u201cTruck\u201d.\n\nEdit: Crows not Cows. ",

The receptionist told the man that if he asked nicely he might be permitted to stay one night in the local temple along with the monks. So the man made his way to the temple. Once there he was greeted by an old monk. \n\n\"Good evening.. ehm.. sir? Something went wrong when booking my hotel. Could I possibly stay here for just one night?\"\n\n\"Of course!\" said the monk. \"We have a room just for tourists like you, we can even offer you some food in the morning. However, I must warn you. You may wake up in the middle of the night hearing a strange sound.\"\n\n\"What strange sound?\" the man asked monk, now very curious as to what this might be about.\n\n\"I wish I could tell you\", said the monk. \"But only monks are allowed to know the source of this sound.\"\n\nAlthough bummed out, the man didn't think much of it. I mean, he got what he wanted. A place to spend the night, and that's all you can ask for. But when he awoke in the middle of the night to the strangest sound he had ever heard in his entire life his curiosity creeped back to him. He NEEDED to know what this unearthly sound was. So when the monk came with his food in the morning he asked him again. \n\n\"I'm sorry\", said the monk. \"But only monks are allowed to know the source of this sound.\"\n\n\"Ok, then I want to become a monk\", said the man.\n\n\"Becoming a monk is not easy, it requires much dedication and many can't do it.\"\n\n\"I'll do whatever it takes, like, absolutely anything. I NEED to know the source of this sound.\"\n\n\"Very well\", the old monk seemed pleased with the answer. \"To become a monk, you must travel the world and count every blade of grass and every grain of sand. Once you do that, you become a monk.\"\n\nThe man walked out of the temple. His journey had now begun. He started traveling all across the world. Counting every blade of grass and every grain of sand. \nMany, many years later he returned to the temple. The old monk were, to his surprise, still alive, waiting for him on the top of the stairs to the temple. \n\n\"So?\"\n\n\"I counted it to 56738370921 blades of grass, and 27489173408820 grains of sand!\" the man said with triumph on his face.\n\n\"I can see your dedication. Congratulations, you are now a monk.\"\n\n\"So... I get to see the source of the sound?\"\n\n\"Yes, you may. Follow me please.\"\n\nSo he followed the old monk. Through the temple and into a tiny room at the back. The only thing housed in this room was a large wooden door.\n\n\"Behind here, is the source of the sound\", said the monk.\n\n\"FINALLY!\" the man thought to himself. \"I FINALLY get to see the source of the sound.\"\nHe walked up to the large wooden door, filled with anticipation. He placed his hand on the handle and slowly opened the door. \n\n\nAnd what was behind the door? I would tell you, but only monks are allowed to know the source of the sound.",

His father kicks him out of the house and orders him never to return.\n\nDown the road, the boy suddenly gets hit by a bus. The driver gets out and asks if he is okay. The boy just asks him what \"Purple Fusion\" means and the boy is then shot by the bus driver.\n\nNow in heaven, the boy asks an angel what \"Purple Fusion\" means. The boy is sent to hell for \"being evil\".\n\nIn hell, the boy asks Satan what \"Purple Fusion\" means and Satan sends him back to heaven for \"being too evil for Satan\".\n\nBack in heaven, the boy asks God what \"Purple Fusion\" means. God hesitates for a moment and says, \"Purple Fusion is a joke with absolutely no punchline that makes everyone mad at you.\"\n\nCredit goes to my sister, who originally told me this joke like 3 or 4 or so years ago. This is actually a simplified version of the joke.",

Wanker!\"\n \nThe manager is naturally a little put off by the man's abrasive manner but his dire need for a top class pianist forces him to agree to an audition. The first tune the pianist plays is an uplifting jazzy number, not too involving, yet utterly melodic.\n \nAt the end the thrilled barman cries,\n\"Wonderful! Wonderful! What was that called?\"\n\"That song, you big nosed fucking twat, was called 'Excuse Me Prime Minister But I Just Spunked In Your Fucking Daughter's Eye, And Now The Cunt's Blind.' \"\n\"Oh\" says the manager, somewhat taken aback, \"err, can you play me another? Something a little less lively maybe?\"\n\"Fucking wanker...\" interjects the pianist before launching into a powerful ballad of such beauty that it leaves the manager in tears.\n \nThe manager, through his teardrops asks him the title.\n\"That little number was called 'Sometimes When You Fuck A Bird Up The Shit Box You Get Crap On Your Bell End.' \"\n\"I see\" says the manager. \"Have you got any songs with less offensive titles?\"\n\"Well there's my jazz number 'Do You Want Me To Spit In Your Ringpiece', or there's the epic 'I Don't Give A Fuck If You're Older My Dear, You've Still Got Fucking Cracking Jugs' \".\n \n\"Look,\" says the manager, \"I think you're a superb pianist but the title of your songs are a little dodgy, to say the least. I will hire you on the condition that you do not introduce your songs or speak to the audience.\"\n \n\"Fuck it\", says the pianist, \"why cunting not?\"\nOn his first night everything is going superbly and the crowd are lapping up his repertoire and his silence is simply being received as modesty. The only thing putting off the pianist is that in the front row there is a gorgeous blonde in a black evening dress with a split up the side revealing the tops of her stockings, and a plunging neckline which boasts a proud and inviting cleavage.\n \nDuring the interval the pianist has got such a stonking hard-on that he decides to go to the bog and knock one out. Just as he has shot his load he hears himself being re-introduced over the sound system, so he rushes back to the stage to finish his act.\n \nAfter the show he is at the bar relaxing when the same blonde approaches him.\n\"Hi\" she says.\n\"Oh, hello\" he winces, struggling to hold in the expletives.\nShe leans over and whispers in his ear,\n\"Do you know your cock is hanging out of your trousers and spunk is dribbling onto your shoes?\"\nPlacing his beer confidently on the bar, the pianist grins, looks her square in the eye and says,\n\"Know it? I fucking wrote it!!\"",

George-a Washington!\"\n\nImmediately Vinny's whole family stands up and erupts into applause. You can hear \"Hey Vinny!\" \"That-a boy!\" \"Way to go!\"\nThe judge puts his hands up \"Ok, ok, everybody calm down... Second question, when was the Declaration of Independence signed?\"\n\nVinny confidently pulls on his collar a bit, put his hands out in front of him, and says \"Judge, another easy one... 1776!\"\nOnce again his family erupts, making more noise than the last time. \"Way to go Vinny!\" \"That-a boy!\"\n\n\"Calm down, calm down\" says the judge.\n\nAt this point Vinny is pretty confident.

He says, \"Who assassinated Abraham Lincoln?\"\n\nThe crowd goes silent.\n\nVinny is looking around with his head down, clearly very distraught. It becomes very apparent that Vinny will not get the answer to this one.\n\nVinny nervously grabs his collar and replies, \"Hey-a judge... well I-a... I don't know that one.\"\n\nHis family erupts in the biggest uproar of the night. People are now jumping up and down in excitement. It seems as if the clock just his midnight on New Years Day. The judge is banging his gavel, completely confused as to what is going on. Vinny turns to his family and raises his hands high in the air as if he just won a grand prize.\n\nFrom deep within the crowd you hear a voice shout out with great pride... \"That-a boy Vinny!

He was a very handsome man, so he had no trouble finding one that he loved. They fell into a passionate love. He said to his wife on the wedding day \u201cI\u2019m so glad I get to marry the love of my life, but I have one request.\u201d His wife replied \u201cOkay honey, anything for you\u201d.  \n&nbsp;  \n\u201cYou can know anything about me, I\u2019ll tell you\u201d the man said \u201cJust don\u2019t ask me about the two black sharks in the white pool.\u201d His wife thought this was very odd and shrugged it off, thinking nothing of it. As time went on, she became more curious. She developed an obsession with it. One day, she couldn\u2019t stand it anymore and asked her husband \u201cI know you told me not to ask, but I really want to know. What\u2019s with the two black sharks in a white pool?\u201d   \n&nbsp;  \nThe man lost it. He went into a rage and grabbed a chair, beating his wife with it and smacking her into the wall. She snapped her neck as he came to his senses. He quickly cleaned up the mess and buried the body in the back yard.  \n&nbsp;  \nDistraught, the man spent much of his time inside his house. Eventually he got the courage to go outside and look once more for love. He fell hard for a very attractive model that also admired the young millionaire. On their wedding he was filled with so much joy that he could love again. That night, he said to her. \u201cHoney, I really do love you and I know you love me, but I have one request.\u201d His wife replied \u201cOf course darling, anything for you\u201d.  \n&nbsp;  \n\u201cYou can know anything about me and I\u2019ll be glad to tell you\u201d the man says \u201cWhatever you do, just don\u2019t ask about the two black sharks in the white pool.\u201d His wife was very curious, but because she loved him and decided to drop it. \u201cOkay darling. You don\u2019t have to worry.\u201d But as time went on she became increasingly curious and decided to ask him one night after some vigorous sex. \u201cDarling,\u201d she said \u201cI know you told me not to ask, but what is the deal with the two black shark in a white pool?\u201d  \n&nbsp;  \nThe man became furious in his attack and started to smother her with the pillow. She writhed for a couple of seconds and eventually suffocated. He came to his senses, weeping that he had killed his wife and went to bury her in the back yard.  \n&nbsp;  \nThe man mourned his second wife for a few months, losing all hope in ever finding love again. One day the millionaire got courage to go out drinking with some buddies and met this lovely blonde reporter. They had a great night and went back to his place to have more drinks. Over the next few months they kept seeing each other. The man finally got the courage to propose and they were married within the year.  \n&nbsp;  \nOn their wedding day he was filled with so much joy that he had found someone to love and spend his life with. That evening he said to her. \u201cOh love, you know that I adore you and I want to be with you, but I have one request.\u201d His wife replied \u201cAnything for you my love\u201d.  \n&nbsp;  \n\u201cYou can know anything about me, nothing is secret\u201d the man said \u201cBut do not ask me about the two black sharks in a white pool\u201d. Having been a reporter, his wife had been successful by getting the scoop on just about every good story, but she loved her husband and respected his wish. Each day that passed she grew more curious, as was her instincts as a reporter. She finally got the courage to ask. \u201cMy love\u201d she said \u201cI know you don\u2019t want me to ask, but I am very curious! What is with the two black sharks in a white pool?\u201d  \n&nbsp;  \nThe man grabs a knife from the kitchen and goes after his wife, stabbing her to death. He realized that he killed his wife, and wept. He quickly buried her in the back yard. One of his neighbors watched him dragging a body and decided to notify the police.  The police arrived at the house and the man answered \u201cGood evening officers, what can I help you with?\u201d  \n&nbsp;  \n\u201cSir we have some information about you and a dead body\u201d one officer says. At this time the neighbor comes over and notifies the police to check the back yard. The police come in and see one freshly dug patch of grass next to a white pool that had two black sharks in it. \u201cWhat\u2019ve you been digging here?\u201d says the other officer. They call in backup to dig in the backyard of the millionaire and find three dead bodies, after which they detain the man.  \n&nbsp;  \nIn the police station they interrogate the man. \u201cWhy do you have three dead bodies in your backyard?\u201d The millionaire was an honest man. In tears he told them about his wives that he\u2019d accidentally killed. \u201cI loved each one of them\u201d says the millionaire \u201cBut even when I told them not to, each one of them asked me about the two black sharks in a white pool.\u201d  \n&nbsp;  \nConfused, the police officer interrogating the man asks \u201cWhat is with the two black sharks in the white pool? We saw them at your house.\u201d The man becomes enraged and starts to attack the officer. The officer fearing for his life grabs his gun and shoots the man in the head.  \n&nbsp;  \nTo this day nobody knows anything about the two black sharks in a white pool.  \n&nbsp;  \nEdit: a word and a requested TL;DR\n",

I had just loaded my favorite mule, Bessie, into the...\"\n\n\"I did not ask you for any details\", the lawyer interrupted. \"Just answer the question. Did you not say, at the scene of the accident, 'I'm fine?'\"\n\nClyde said, \"Well, I had  just got Bessie into the trailer and I was driving  down the road.\" \n\nThe lawyer interrupted again and said \"Judge, I'm trying to establish the fact that, at the scene of the accident, this man told the highway patrolman on the scene that he was just fine. Now several weeks after the accident he is trying to sue my client. I believe he is a fraud. Please tell him to simply answer the question.\"\n\nBy this time the judge was fairly interested in Clyde's answer and said to the lawyer \"I'd like to hear what he has to say about his favorite mule, Bessie.\"\n\nClyde thanked the judge and proceeded.\n\n\"Well as I was saying, I had just loaded Bessie, my favorite mule, into the trailer and was driving down the highway when this huge semi-truck and trailer ran the stop sign and smacked my truck right in the side.  I was thrown into one ditch and Bessie was thrown into the other. I was hurting real bad and didn't want to move. However, I could hear old Bessie moaning and groaning. I knew she was in terrible shape just by her groans.\n\nWhen the highway patrolman came on the scene he could hear Bessie moaning and groaning so he went over to her. After he looked at her and saw her near fatal condition, he took out his gun and shot her between the eyes.\n\nThen the patrolman came across the road, gun still in hand, looked at me and said, 'how are you feeling?'\n\nNow what the fuck would you say?\"\n\nEdit: wow not only is this my first post over 100 but it's front page and some kind hearted financier hath gilded this lowly pleb.

And he liked to assert his superiority in calling last minute, mandatory, all-hands-required meetings.\n\nWhen the staff heard that there was one of these meetings coming up, he knew that there would be trouble. And sure enough, when the CEO arrived (five minutes late), he went straight into a tirade about\u2026 flying alligators.\n\nAfter he finished the room went silent. The CEO turned red.\n\n> I don't believe that you have all understood the gravity of this situation.\n\nFacing the COO he shouted, \n\n> Dave, why aren't you concerned about this\u203d You mean to tell me that you don't believe in flying alligators\u203d\n\nDave replied,\n\n> I do sir, it's just, they fly really, really low.",
