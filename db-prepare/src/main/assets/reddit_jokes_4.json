It was late, and raining very hard. Bob could barely see 20 feet in front of the car. \n\nSuddenly the car skids out of control! Bob attempts to control the car, but to no avail! The car swerves and smashes into a tree. \n\nMoments later, Bob shakes his head to clear the fog. Dazed, he looks over at the passenger seat and sees his wife unconscious, with her head bleeding! Despite the rain and unfamiliar countryside, Bob knows he has to carry her to the nearest phone. \n\nBob carefully picks his wife up and begins trudging down the road. After a short while, he sees a light. He heads towards the light, which is coming from an old, large house. He approaches the door and knocks. \n\nA minute passes. A small, hunched man opens the door. Bob immediately blurts, \"Hello, my name is Bob Hill, and this is my wife Betty. We've been in a terrible accident, and my wife has been seriously hurt. Can I please use your phone??\" \n\n\"I'm sorry,\" replied the hunchback, \"but we don't have a phone. My master is a Doctor; come in and I will get him!\" \n\nBob brings his wife in. An elegant man comes down the stairs. \"I'm afraid my assistant may have misled you. I am not a medical doctor; I am a scientist. However, it is many miles to the nearest clinic, and I have had a basic medical training. I will see what I can do. Igor, bring them down to the laboratory.\" \n\nWith that, Igor picks up Betty and carries her downstairs, with Bob following closely. Igor places Betty on a table in the lab. Bob collapses from exhaustion and his own injuries, so Igor places Bob on an adjoining table. \n\nAfter a brief examination, Igor's master looks worried. \"Things are serious, Igor. Prepare a transfusion.\" Igor and his master work feverishly, but to no avail. Bob and Betty Hill are no more. \n\nThe Hills' deaths upset Igor's master greatly. Wearily, he climbs the steps to his conservatory, which houses his grand piano. For it is here that he has always found solace. He begins to play, and a stirring, almost haunting, melody fills the house. \n\nMeanwhile, Igor is still in the lab tidying up. His eyes catch movement, and he notices the fingers on Betty's hand twitch. Stunned, he watches as Bob's arm begins to rise! He is further amazed as Betty sits straight up! \n\nUnable to contain himself, he dashes up the stairs to the conservatory. He bursts in and shouts to his master: \n\n\"Master, Master! ...

However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished.\n\nFinally, the son said, \"Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have a pink ping pong ball.\"\n\nThe father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, \"If it is a pink ping pong ball that you want, a pink ping pong ball you shall have.\"\n\nAnd so, the next day, the son was given as his bithday present a pink ping pong ball.\n\nThe boy took the ball to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong ball was gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong ball, however, was never seen again.\n\nThe next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday.\n\n\"Father,\" replied the son, \"I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.\"\n\nThe father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. he said therefore, \"If it is a tenpack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a tenpack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.\"\n\nAnd so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.\n\nThe boy took the tenpack of balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ball remained, merely the empty husk of the tenpack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again.\n\nThe next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday.\n\n\"Father,\" said the son to this, \"I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.\"\n\nThe father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. \"A carton of pink ping pong balls?\"\n\n\"A carton of pink ping pong balls,\" the boy confirmed.\n\n\"I can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,\" said the father, \"but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.\" And so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls.\n\nThe boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared.\n\n\"Dear son,\" said the father, \"I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?\"\n\nThe son, however, was reluctant to tell him. \"Please humour me, dear father.\"\n\nThe carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. The next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday. \"Dearest father,\" the son started, \"I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.\" One of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humour his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory. The next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home.\n\nThe following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left.\n\nThe following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong.\n\n\"Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible.\" It was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country. The next day, the father took his son to the harbour and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there.\n\n\"Father,\" the son said, \"You've made me very happy yet again.\" That night, the son spent on board the tanker.\n\nThe next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy.\n\nA few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital.\n\nHis father visited the young man in hospital. \"My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?\"\n\nWeakly, the son sat up in bed. \"Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one tenpack of pink ping pong balls.\"\n\nThe father held his son's hand tightly. \"Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.\"\n\n\"Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.\"\n\nThe father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk.\n\n\"Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.\"\n\nThe son nodded weakly.\n\nThe next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room.\n\n\"Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls,\" the father requested.\n\nThe son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter.\n\n\"I-\" the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth.\n\n\"I- I-\"\n\nThen he died.",

        "body": "he was the original gangster copied a million times over here goes.. his words : Last weekend I saw something at Larry's Pistol & Pawn Shop that sparked my interest. The occasion was our 22nd anniversary and I was looking for a little something extra for my wife, Toni. What I came across was a 100,000-volt, pocket/purse-sized taser. The effects of the taser were suppose to be short lived, with no long-term adverse affect on your assailant, allowing her adequate time to retreat to safety.... WAY TOO COOL!   Long story short, I bought the device and brought it home. I loaded two triple-a batteries in the darn thing and pushed the button. Nothing! I was disappointed. I learned, however, that if I pushed the button AND pressed it against a metal surface at the same time; I'd get the blue arch of electricity darting back and forth between the prongs.   Awesome!!!   Unfortunately, I have yet to explain to Toni what that burn spot is on the face of her microwave.   Okay, so I was home alone with this new toy, thinking to myself that it couldn't be all that bad with only two triple-a batteries,... right?  \n \nThere I sat in my recliner, my cat Gracie looking on intently (trusting little soul) while I was reading the directions and thinking that I really needed to try this thing out on a flesh & blood moving target. I must admit I thought about zapping Gracie (for a fraction of a second) and thought better of it. She is such a sweet cat. But, if I was going to give this thing to my wife to protect herself against a mugger, I did want some assurance that it would work as advertised. Am I wrong?   So, there I sat in a pair of shorts and a tank top with my reading glasses perched delicately on the bridge of my nose, directions in one hand, taser in another.\n \nThe directions said that a one-second burst would shock and disorient your assailant; a two-second burst was supposed to cause muscle spasms and a major loss of bodily control; a three-second burst would purportedly make your assailant flop on the ground like a fish out of water. Any burst longer than three seconds would be wasting the batteries.   All the while I'm looking at this little device measuring about 5\" long, less than 3/4 inch in circumference; pretty cute really and loaded with two itsy, bitsy triple-a batteries) thinking to myself, \"no possible way!\"   What happened next is almost beyond description, but I'll do my best.....   I'm sitting there alone, Gracie looking on with her head cocked to one side as to say, \"don't do it master,\" reasoning that a one-second burst from such a tiny little ole thing couldn't hurt all that bad.... I decided to give myself a one-second burst just for the heck of it.\n \nI touched the prongs to my naked thigh, pushed the button, and HOLY MOTHER, WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION@!@$$!% !@*!!!   I'm pretty sure Jessie Ventura ran in through the side door, picked me up in the recliner, then body slammed us both on the carpet, over and over and over again. I vaguely recall waking up on my side in the fetal position, with tears in my eyes, body soaking wet, both nipples on fire, testicles nowhere to be found, with my left arm tucked under my body in the oddest position, and tingling in my legs. The cat was standing over me making meowing sounds I had never heard before, licking my face, undoubtedly thinking to herself, \"do it again, do it again!\"   Note: If you ever feel compelled to \"mug\" yourself with a taser, one note of caution: there is no such thing as a one-second burst when you zap yourself. You will not let go of that thing until it is dislodged from your hand by a violent thrashing about on the floor. A three second burst would be considered conservative.   SON-OF-A- ... that hurt like hell!!!\n \nA minute or so later (I can't be sure, as time was a relative thing at that point), collected my wits (what little I had left), sat up and surveyed the landscape. My bent reading glasses were on the mantle of the fireplace. How did they get up there??? My triceps, right thigh and both nipples were still twitching. My face felt like it had been shot up with Novacaine, and my bottom lip weighed 88 lbs. I'm still looking for my testicles. I'm offering a significant reward for their safe return.

I cannot go one more day with these penguins living here.\"\n\nThe man, saddened by his failed attempt to keep the penguins at least one more day, begrudgingly picks up the phone.\n\n\"Hello, County Zoo, how may I help you?\" Spoke the cheery voice on the phone.\n\n The man took a deep breath and spoke slowly. \n\n\"Hello, I'd like to speak to the person in charge of accepting donations please.\"\n\nThe receptionist on the other end of the line could hear the sadness in his voice. \n\n\"I'll connect you right away sir\" \n\nThe phone was silent for a minute. The man hoped that no one would be connected, that perhaps he could have one last day with the penguins.\n\n\"Hello, County Zoo donation office. How may I assist you?\"\n\n The man's heart sank \"Hello, I have a very large collection of penguins I would like to donate.\"\n\n\"Penguins?\"\n\n\"Yes, penguins.\"\n\n\"Like, real penguins?\"\n\n\"Yes, real penguins.\"\n\n\"That's fantastic!!\" The donation coordinator exclaimed \"We have been trying to get penguins here for a long time! We have an area all set up, but no penguins to live there!\"\n\nThe man smiled to himself. This person seemed very excited to get these penguins. At least they would be going to a happy home and they wouldn't be too far away so he could go visit. \n\n\"My wife says I need to get rid of them today\"\n\n\"Fantastic! Come on down anytime, we will be waiting!\"\n\nIt was settled. The many attached his trailer to his truck and started loading up the penguins. After spending an hour counting the penguins to make sure he had them all the man closed the trailer door and stared to drive to the County Zoo. The man got about halfway there and sure enough he got a flat tire.\n\n\"Damn it!!\" The man thought to himself. \"The County Zoo is almost closed, how will I explain to my wife if I come home with all these penguins.\" \n\nIt was at that point that the man saw another truck coming down the road. He flagged the truck down.\n\n\"Sir you have to help me! I need to get these penguins to the County Zoo. They are about to close soon and my wife will kill me if I don't take these penguins to the County Zoo today.\"\n\n\"You want me to take these penguins to the County Zoo?\" replied the stranger.\n\n\"Yes! Please! I'll pay for you to take them to the County Zoo. How about $500. Is that enough for you to take them?\"\n\nThe stranger took the money.\n\n\"Yeah, that should be enough.\"\n\nSo the two men loaded up the strangers truck with all the penguins and off the stranger went.\n\nAfter a while the man finally got his truck fixed and off he went to the County Zoo. When he got there though the County Zoo was closed. The man started banging on the gate and yelling until a security guard showed up.\n\n\"What is your problem?\" Scoffed the security guard.\n\n\"Please tell me, did my penguins arrive safely, are they all there? May I see them in their new home?\" Pleaded the man.\n\n\"Penguins? We were excepting some penguins, but we never got them.\"\n\n\"WHAT!?!\" The man was furious!! \"That jerk stole all my penguins and my $500 was a rude person!!\"\n\n\"Sorry, sir.\"\n\nThe man needed a way to blow off steam. He decided to drive around for a while before going home to his wife.\n\nAfter, maybe, 30-40 minutes the man sees the stranger from earlier. There he was. Walking down the street with a row of penguins following him, far as the eye can see.\n\nThe man slammed on his breaks.\n\nHe hopped out of his car.\n\nHe approached the stranger and said,\n\n\"Hey! Jerk! How dare you! How dare you steal my $500 and not take the penguins to the County Zoo!\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Said the stranger. I already took them to the County Zoo. I had money left over so I was taking them to the movie theatre.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Life for him, his wife Susan, his mom Louis, and their three kids John Jr (JJ), Alexis, and Peter was perfect.\n\nAll that changed though when one day, right across the street, a new shop opened: Holy Brothers Holy Flowers. Intrigued, he went over to introduce himself. Turns out two Friars had recently left their order to open a flower store. They were elderly gentleman who had spent decades tending the garden at their Friary, but ultimately wanted to go live in the outside world. John was friendly, and thought to himself \u201cwell, I\u2019m sure this town can support two florists,\u201d so we went back to his store and thought nothing more of it. \n\nBut as time went on more and more people started going to Holy Flowers. A rumor had gotten started that the flowers were blessed, and that you\u2019d get good luck by going there. Sales dropped for John, money got tight, and he started to accrue debt. Finally, nobody came into his store at all any more.\n\nOne day, out of desperation, he went across the street to talk to the friars. He said \u201cguys, I need you to move your store. My family has owned this place for five generations and I\u2019m going to lose it.\u201d The friars told him to fuck off.\n\nHe went home and told his wife. Thinking a womans touch might help, she went to talk to the friars. \u201cMy family is going to lose our home, please move to the next town over.\u201d She was again told to fuck off.\n\nIn a moment of despair, they sent their children to go plead their case. JJ, Alexis, and Peter went to see the Friars. \u201cPlease sirs, or parents are losing everything, you have to help us out.\u201d They too were told to fuck off.\n\nNext, John\u2019s mother Louis, a kindly, persuasive, but tough woman went to talk to them. She was told to fuck off.\n\nSitting in his dusty empty store John contemplated his failings while he killed a bottle of cheap whiskey. His store, his future, he\u2019s lost all of it. Sitting in a stupor, a thought drifted into his mind. He remembered an old family \u2013 acquaintance. He picked up the phone and called the man, a huge (probably former felon) guy named Hugh. Nobody knew exactly what Hugh did, but he wasn\u2019t a good guy. John\u2019s dad had done Hugh a favor once so they were in his good graces, but this was a man to be respected and feared. \n\nJohn explained the situation to Hugh over the phone, who simply said \u201cI\u2019ll deal with it\u201d and hung up the phone. \n\nTwo days later Holy Flowers closed. No explanation, no closing sale, the just shut their doors, drove out of town as fast as they could, leaving everything behind. Customers started coming back to John, and he lived happily ever after.\n\nThe moral of the story? Hugh, and only Hugh, can prevent florist friars.",

I wanted to surprise her, I wanted her to know that I cared about her and that I will and will always be there for her \u2026 the thing is my wife had nightmares about me being unalive and that she\u2019d be a widow and the only person by her side at my funeral was my friend. \n\nI decided go to my best friends house, which a stones throw away from mine first, because I had the strangest gut feeling that he would be with my wife that night\u2026 Don\u2019t get me wrong I love them both and I love the fact that they get along, but I just couldn\u2019t get the thought out of my head, and when I went over to his \u2026 empty house, I had a moment of clarity. I was not mad, I was not angry, I was not enraged, in fact, it was all a seiner blob of thought. All  those times when he\u2019d as us to have dinner together and I\u2019d be the only one who\u2019d say \u201cno\u201d, all those time my wife said he was a cute\u2026 \n\nAt this moment, I felt \u2026 happy . I was glad , I couldn\u2019t believe myself. I was glad that my best friend cared this deeply about my wife, and I was glad that my wife loved my best friend this much, I was incredebally happy !!  I could now surprise them together in my own bed room !! As I unlocked my house doors, I was careful not to make a sound and wake them up, and as I walked closer to my bed room, I saw two plates in the dining area, and I opened my bed room door as slowly as I could.\n\nI was correct \u2026 My best friend was sleeping in the warm embrace of my wife, and it was so \u2026 cute, but as I took another step, the floor board creaked and my friend who had a keen ear looked around and saw me. For a moment he did not know what to do, but the very next he jolted towards me; and in the process woke my wife up. When he got close enough, he put his hands on my chest and stared kissing my all over my face, and my wife looked sheepishly at us and fell onto the bed cheekily whilst opening her arms for a hug and said \u201c I missed you ... \u201c. \n\nI kissed my friend and went over to my wife and said, \u201c You know, I knew that you\u2019d be with him, and I love the both of you for that\u201d, while hugging her. My best friend joined in on the hug and I decided at that moment that he\u2019d move in with us and would have dinner with us every night.

Jim got out the fruits he brought, and Maximilian carefully took out his lasagna while the three were engaging in small talk. \"Beautiful day, right Tim?\" said Jim, as Tim murmured a soft yes while frantically searching in his giant bag. Maximilian noticed something was wrong, and asked \"What's the matter, Tim?\" Tim said, \"I made six Cubanos this morning, I see only two.\" Maximilian responded, \"Don't worry, we can manage with two and what we've got here.\" Tim anxiously said, \"No you don't understand, I spent an awful lot of time learning how to make these and spent the whole night yesterday and morning today so I could get these right.\" Jim: \"Tim, you've been through a lot this week, you should've taken some rest instead. Take a seat, no worries we'll share.\"\n\n\"Shut the fuck up,\" came the blunt response from Tim as he almost dove into his bag desperately trying to find his remaining four Cubanos. A concerned Maximilian commented, \"This guy really needs to chill, he's taking this way too seriously.\" Tim snapped, and he jumped on Maximilian and brutally beat him up, before stepping on his face until he was bleeding profusely and unable to move. A shocked Jim took two steps back before charging at Tim, who tackled him and immediately threw him to the ground and delivered some hard punches to Jim's stomach before smashing a glass bottle on his head, leaving him unconscious. Just as Maximilian recovered, Tim held him to the tree and stabbed him with the broken glass bottle. Maximilian slumped as Tim watched both of them, standing in his bloodied t-shirt and panting heavily.\n\nA bystander nearby saw all of this and said to his friend: \"It looks like that guy was a few sandwiches short of a picnic.\"",

She had gotten into trouble at school and at home. Carol's mother asked her if she thought she deserved to get a bike for her birthday. Little Carol, of course, thought she did. Carol's mother, been a Christian woman, wanted her to reflect on her behavior over the last year, and write a letter to God and tell him why she deserved a bike for her birthday. Little Carol stomped up the steps to her room and sat down to write God a letter.\n\nLetter 1:\n\nDear God, \n\nI have been a very good girl this year and I would like a bike for my birthday. I want a red one.\n\nYour friend, Carol\n\n\nCarol knew this wasn't true. She had not been a very good girl this year, so she tore up the letter and started over.\n\n\nLetter 2: \n\nDear God, \n\nThis is your friend Carol. I have been a pretty good girl this year, and I would like a red bike for my birthday.\n\nThank You, Carol\n\n\nCarol knew this wasn't true either. So she tore up the letter and started again.\n\n\nLetter 3:\n\nDear God, \n\nI know I haven't been a good girl this year. I am very sorry. I will be a good girl if you just send me a red bike for my birthday.\n\nThank you, Carol\n\n\nCarol knew, even if it was true, this letter was not going to get her a bike. By now, she was very upset. She went downstairs and told her mother she wanted to go to church. Carol's mother thought her plan had worked because Carol looked very sad.\n\"Just be home in time for dinner,\" her mother said... Carol walked down the street to the church and up to the altar. She looked around to see if anyone was there. She picked up a statue of the Virgin Mary, slipped it under her jacket and ran out of the church, down the street, into her house, and up to her room. She shut the door and sat down and wrote her letter to God...\n\nLetter 4:\n\n\nI GOT YOUR MAMA.\nIF YOU WANT TO SEE HER AGAIN, SEND THE BIKE. \n\nSigned, YOU KNOW WHO",

John stands up. \"I'll bet you fifty bucks, in exactly an hour a seagull will fly over, and shit exactly on this spot.\" The other man laughs, says \"You're on!\", and they shake on it.\n\nThey both come back to the deck close to an hour later. After a few minutes, sure enough, they hear the calls of a gull, followed by a faint splat. The salior looks down in disbelief at the pile of bird shit on the center of the tape. He pays up.\n\nA couple of days pass. It's a beautiful day, not a cloud in the sky. Back on the deck, another salior finds John walking around in his rain coat, and asks why he's wearing such odd attire on such a pretty day. \"I'll bet you 100 dollars that you're gonna regret not wearing yours too in just a minute.\" The second man looks at him, and takes the bet. He begins to walk away, but before he can take a dozen steps, a single dark cloud forms in the sky and begins to soak the entire ship. \n\nThese strange bets continue, and before long, news reaches the captain of the ship. He wants this madman off his boat. He calls some friends in high places, and gets John transfered to another vessel. A few days later, he receives a phone call from the commander of the destroyer John was placed on.\n\n\"You know,\" says the commander, \"I don't see why you wanted him gone so bad. I've already won five thousand from him. He's not as good as you said.\"\n\n\"What? How'd you pull that off?\"\n\nThe commander laughs. \"The idiot bet me that I had hemorrhoids! I've never had them in my life, easy money! It was a little awkward proving it, but worth it.\"\n\n\"How'd you prove it?\"\n\n\"Simple. I pulled down my pants, and showed him my asshole. He still didn't believe me, so he grabbed a broom and poked at me, and finally was convinced. Easiest five grand I've ever made.\"\n\nThere was a silence, and the captain finally said, \"Throw that son of a bitch overboard right now.\"\n\n\"What? Why?\" asked the commander.\n\n\"Because on his last day before the transfer, he bet me twenty thousand that he'd willingly have a broomstick up your ass by the end of the first week.\"",

The officer in charge soon noticed that Ole was getting a 99% sign-up rate for the more expensive supplemental form of GI insurance.\n \nThis was remarkable, because it cost these low-income recruits $30 per month for the higher coverage, compared to what the government was already providing at no charge.

An employee of the bank then drives the Rolls into the bank's underground garage and parks it there. Two weeks later, the blonde returns and repays the $5,000 and the interest, which comes to $15.41. The loan officer says, \"Miss, we are very happy to have had your business, and this transaction has worked out very nicely; but we are a little puzzled. We checked you out and found that you are a multimillionaire.

Just give it a urine sample and the computer'll tell you what's wrong and what to do about it. It takes ten seconds and costs ten dollars...a hell of a lot cheaper than a doctor.\" \n\nSo Jack deposits a urine sample in a small jar and takes it to the drugstore. He deposits ten dollars, and the computer lights up and asks for the urine sample. He pours the sample into the slot and waits. \n\nTen seconds later, the computer ejects a printout: You have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water and avoid heavy activity. It will improve in two weeks. \n\nThat evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was, Jack began wondering if the computer could be fooled. He mixed some tap water, a stool sample from his dog, urine samples from his wife and daughter, and masturbated into the mixture for good measure. \n\nJack hurries back to the drugstore, eager to check the results. He deposits ten dollars, pours in his concoction, and awaits the results. \n\nThe computer prints the following:\n \n1. Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener. \n2. Your dog has ringworm. Bathe him with anti-fungal shampoo. \n3. Your daughter has a cocaine habit. Get her into rehab. \n4. Your wife is pregnant...twin girls. They aren't yours. Get a lawyer. \n5.

The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner. The third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a looped rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor.\n\nThe next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought.\nThe battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage. The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious.\n\nAnd it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.",

When he arrives, the first thing he sees is a giant glass jar in the far corner of the room, 7 feet by 6 feet, packed to the brim with $10 bills. \n\nHe sits down and asks his buddies, \"What's with the jar?\" \n\"No idea\" responds his friend, so the man asks the bartender.\nIn his thick Irish accent, \"Ah, ye warnt a know bout the haus game does yer? That'll be $10.\"\n\nAnnoyed but intrigued, the man pulls out a $10 and lays it on the bar, and the old man begins, \"To win all the money in that there jar, I have a gallon jug of tequila ya hafta take all down at one go and not flinch or make a face,\" then he points to the back door, \"I have a pit bull chained out back with an aching tooth ya gotta pull, but watch out, she's mean as a blarney so be careful, and at last, I gots a 90 year old lass upstairs, who's never had an orgasm in her life. You gotta go up there and make things right for her.\" \n\nThe man stands, shakes his head as he returns the table. \"I understand!\" yells the bartender, \"But yer $10 stays in the jar.\"\n\nSo the guy get into a bit of a drinking session with his buddies, but can't stop thinking about the jar. If he could suck it up, just for one night, he could change his life. \n\nFinally, with enough liquid courage, he stumbles up the the bar and slams down a $10 bill. \"Gimme the tequila.\" The bartender hands him the jug and he throws it back as hard as he can, throats burning, tears rolling down his face, he finishes every drop and slams it down, without making a face. The bartender points to the door, now the man staggers through the backdoor, and the barking ensues, trash cans are crashing, there's a loud scream then silence. \"Awh geez says the bartender, they fuckin' killed each other.\" As he shoos the crowd back he gets to the door, the man bursts thru, shirt shredded, bloodied and bruised, he shouts, \"Alright, now where's the old lady with the sore tooth?!\"",

She replied, \"$165,000!\" and dumped the cash out of her bag onto his desk. The president was of course curious as to how she came by all this cash, so he asked her, \"Madam, I'm surprised you're carrying so much cash around. Where did you get this money?\" The old lady replied, \"I make bets.\" The president then asked, \"Bets? What kind of bets?\" The old woman said, \"Well, for example, I'll bet you $25,000 that your balls are square.\" The president laughs, \"That's a stupid bet. You can never win that kind of bet!\" The old lady challenged, \"So, would you like to take my bet?\" The president agrees, \"Sure, I'll bet $25,000 that my balls aren't square!\" The little old lady then said, \"Okay, but since there is a lot of money involved, may I bring my lawyer with me tomorrow at 10am as a witness?\"\n\"Sure!\" replied the confident president.\n\nThat night, the president got very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of a mirror checking his balls, turning from side to side, again and again. He thoroughly checked them out until he was sure that there was absolutely no way his balls were square and that he would win the bet. The next morning, at precisely 10am, the little old lady appeared with her lawyer at the president's office.\n\nShe introduced the lawyer to the president and repeated the bet \"$25,000 says the president's balls are square!\" The president agreed with the bet again and the old lady asked him to drop his pants so they could all see. The president complied. The little old lady peered closely at his balls and then asked if she could feel them. \"Well, Okay,\" said the president, \"$25,000 is a lot of money, so I guess you should be absolutely sure.\"\n\nJust then, he noticed that the lawyer was quietly banging his head against the wall. The president asked the old lady, \"What the hell's the matter with your lawyer?\" She replied, \"Nothing, except I bet him $100,000 that at 10am today I'd have The Bank of Canada's president's balls in my hand.\"",

Instead of a band of gorillas, just two. The rest of the zoo animals were just as sparse.\n\nOne day during a thunder and lightning storm, a single bolt of lightning struck the two remaining gorillas and killed them both instantly. Thankfully due to the storm, there were no people visiting the zoo and so the general public wasnt aware of the tragedy. The head zookeeper pulled a staff member aside and said \"Hey, I've got a gorilla suit in the back. Why dont you put it on every day, get in the habitat and act like a gorilla and I'll see that you get paid an extra $50 a day.\"\n\nThe staff member agreed, and everything seemed to be working out fine. The public thought it was an authentic gorilla, the staff member made an extra $50 a day and the zoo didnt have to go through the trouble of finding a new gorilla plus deal with the financial hassle of maintaining a real animal.\n\nThe staff member realized one day that he could swing on the artificial vines on the tree in the habitat. He got quite good at it, and would at times swing out so far that he would leave the gorilla enclosure. The head zookeeper didnt care because he knew the gorilla was really a man in a gorilla suit, so he let it continue. The public loved it, thinking that a real gorilla was actually getting out of the enclosure, it heightened their sense of enjoyment.\n\nOne fateful day, when the staff member gave a particularly vigorous swing, his momentum carried him quite far out of the range of the gorilla enclosure. In fact, he realized he was directly over the lion habitat. At that moment, the artifical vine snapped, and he tumbled down through the air. He landed flat on his back, knocking the wind out of him.\n\nThe lone lion saw the gorilla fall, and sprang over with a roar. The man in the gorilla suit was terrified, and as his breath returned to him, he began to yell for help. \"SAVE ME!!! I'M NOT A REAL GORILLA!!!\" he yelled. At that moment, the lion moved his jaws towards the monkey head, opened his mouth and said...\n\n\"Shut up you idiot, or we will both lose our jobs!\"",

It would spew yellow flames in all directions, repeatedly striking the bells in the tall clock in the corner or even landing in the ink wells on the desks, sizzling as the flames sputtered out. After searing his eyebrows for the 3rd time, he raised his hand for the professor to come over and help him. She looks over his shoulder, sees the writing in his book, and immediately recognizes the issue. The previous owner had spilled some tea on the pages and had attempted to re-write some of the words where the ink had faded. The result?

A test that would surely be able to leave them with one man at the most.\n\nHe invites the Englishman to a room, this room had two doors, one where they entered and another directly behind the chief.

        "body": "By the 15th century, the Templar Knights had disappeared, but deep in the bowels of the British Museum in a case well sealed and protected lies a strange memorial to their impact on the city of London.\n\nLondon of the early 12th century was on its way to becoming an impressive city, but its life and its blood was the Thames River. Without the river commerce would grind to a halt as the people of London discovered to their horror in 1216.\n\nThe first ships seemed simply to have disappeared, but the monster wasted little time in this caution. Soon, many Londoners had seen the gaping maw licked by flames dragging a hapless crew to its death. It was a fire salamander, and in the Autumn of 1216 it was estimated to be 40 feet long with jaws that gaped 10 feet wide.\n\nBy the spring of 1217, the monster was no longer a nuisance, it was a deadly plague. No boat could navigate the Thames\u2026 no raft was small enough, no ship was large enough to resist the demon of the Thames. Worse, the beast was growing! The latest reports called it 70 feet long with jaws opening 15 feet. Our instinct is to discount this absurd growth, and yet few could impeach its source.\n\nHe, our source, enters the story in August of 1217. London had begged, prayed, blasphemed, and killed in desperate attempts to exorcise or appease their curse; to no avail. On June 14, four men painted themselves with the Devil\u2019s Cross and proclaimed themselves the Dark Priests of the Beast. They built a ship and doused it in oil; then, they sailed it down the river. Dark Priests they may have been, but they died screaming like any man. On July 28, London sent three virgins (the youngest not yet 13) down the Thames to the monster. It was thought that this would appease the evil god: the monster\u2019s hunger exceeded even this atrocity.\n\nOn August 23, our source received his summons. His given name is lost in his chosen name: Honorus. He was a Templar Knight and possibly a saint. That morning, he was commanded to destroy the beast.\n\nLondon in fear and desperation had turned to their most jealous weapon, the Templars\u2026 warrior monks who fought with the fierce, perhaps fanatic, frenzy of the devout. The city had exhausted all other options; the monks were its last hope, and Honorus was the greatest of the Knights.\n\nThe battle was truly a footnote to his preparation\u2026 Honorus ventured into the woods upstream from London. He forsook shelter, clothing, food, and sleep for four days, meditating on the coming struggle. When the four days ended, he stalked and killed a stag without weapon or aid. With the skin of the stag he made clothing; from its flesh he regained his strength; and with its guts, he lashed five logs into a raft fit for his purpose.\n\nHonorus set the raft in motion. He had outfitted himself with the only item he would use in this fight which had not come out of the forest with him. A sword of Spanish steel, blue with the sky, lay in his lap. Soon, he felt the swell of the water disturb his raft: the monster was coming, yet he sat unmoving.\n\nThe beast broke the surface.\n\nNo human is perfect; a splinter of the collapsing raft clipped Honorus\u2019 left foot as he leapt into the water. He had timed his jump slightly too late, but no matter, the injury will not be important until after the battle.\n\nThe monster was above the water only momentarily; time enough for Honorus to drive his sword between two of its scales. The monster thrashed in pain, turning its exposed flesh from the steaming water. Honorus was lifted from the water as the beast rolled. He gauged his stroke and leapt, striking the monster\u2019s eye.\n\nAngered and half blinded, the beast threw Honorus into the river and grasped him in its immense jaws. Honorus swam quickly past the teeth into the monster\u2019s mouth. Inside, the questing tongue scalded his feet as he searched for purchase again, and we shall ignore this injury for now.\n\nOnce he had braced himself inside the beast\u2019s mouth, pushing with all his strength against the slowly rising tongue, he took aim. Honorus had time to make only one thrust.\n\nWhen his journal recalls these events, it attributes Honorus\u2019 \u201cluck\u201d in this battle to aid from the Divine. We do not wish to detract from the glory of God, but surely He will not envy His servant. Is it coincidence that Honorus\u2019 blade struck true to the brain? Honorus had already studied carefully the anatomy of the salamander a week before he was summoned to fight the beast. Did Honorus not know that the water\u2019s rush against the beast\u2019s exposed flank would cause it such pain? In his journal, \u201cAugust 24: And once I am atop the beast and it has rolled from the water, where then to strike?\u201d\n\nTwo weeks after Honorus was told to lift the curse of London, the beast was dead. The next day London celebrated Honorus; the town would live because of him. Three days later, gratitude had disappeared.\n\nThe body of the beast had lodged itself firmly in the mire less than half a mile downstream of London. Although it was yet intact (perhaps due to its incredible armor), it would surely soon rot. While not so great a terror, the rotting beast would be almost as dangerous as the live beast, attracting disease and scavengers. No ship could move the carcass. The people of London called upon Honorus.\n\nHonorus\u2019 solution was difficult but practical, and he began as soon as he had retrieved his sword. He fasted for two days; then, he ate the cooked meat of the huge salamander and fasted for a third day. When he suffered no ill effects, Honorus began dissecting the beast. With the help of London, Honorus soon had all the usable meat and intestines of the dead beast transformed into sausage.\n\nA bizarre solution it was, but a good one. The sausage was soon discovered to be excellent and to keep easily for very long periods of time. Even more important, the sausage fast became incredibly popular throughout England and much of Europe. It began to reestablish the fame of London\u2019s trade after the Hiatus of the Beast.\n\nStill, Honorus has one final contribution to this history\u2026 It became vital that everyone knew from whence the incredible sausage of London came, and thus we return to Honorus\u2019 injuries.\n\nAfter the battle with the live beast and the crisis of the dead beast, Honorus took time to recover. Six weeks after he was first summoned, he was dressing the injuries on his feet. The problems of London were known to him. As he dipped a strip of paper like gauze into a healing salve, he had a thought.\n\nOne week later, each sausage shipped from London carried a fascinating new development: a label. Just as the gauze dried and closed on Honorus\u2019 foot, the parchment around these sausages was attached; and all would know the fame of London from each link she sold.\n\nIn the end, despite all his other feats, it was this idea, the product label, that survived Honorus. In tribute to this advance, the British Museum houses the only known surviving label from Honorus\u2019 sausages. And although even the tough gut of the Beast has long since faded to dust, the label may still be read. If our reader could go to the Museum and enter the Medieval wing\u2019s most treasured collection, she could still read, in faint letters, the Label of Honor:\u2026 It Was The Beast Of Thames, It Was The Wurst Of Thames\u2026",

His car was around 20 years old and was not really up to the trip, but needing to close a deal for his company, he was determined to make it there on time.\n\nSo he started to drive down the highway. He spent an hour or so on the freeway and things were going well but he saw ahead there was a large backup in traffic. Not knowing how long this jam would take he uses his phone's gps to find an alternate route.\n\nHe exits the freeway and starts down a long two lane road that began to wind through the mountains. After many miles he begins to question weather this was really the best road he could have taken, but the gps said that in another 30 miles he would re-join the highway, so he continued on.\n\nAs he was driving he encountered a very steep climb up through a mountain pass. As he reached the top he heard a loud bang and the vehicle shook violently. He coasted just enough to make it over the pass and start downhill. He stopped at the peak of the climb and opened up the hood and being not very mechanically inclined, he had no idea what was wrong.\n\nHe got back in the car and tried to start the car but it just would not start. So he decided to try and coast down the hill and see how far he could get, or possibly come across a petrol station.\n\nHe coasted down the hill for almost a full mile and as it flattened out, slowly the car rolled to a halt. Having seen nothing within the Last ten miles he decides to try and call a towing company to get his car, but his phone has no signal and is almost dead.\n\nSo having seen nothing in the last 20 miles, he decides to lock his car and continue on foot to see if he can find someone with a phone.\n\nHe continues on foot for several miles till he sees a small driveway which shows no signs of recent use. He decides it's worth a shot to go check this out. He walks down this driveway for at least half a mile before he finds a massive iron gate connected to a large stone wall on each side. As he approaches the gate, the gate creaks and squeaks and slowly opens inward.\n\nA bit startled, he cautiously walks through the gate and continues down the path. He hears a noise behind him and he turns to see the gate slowly swing shut and close with a loud bang. The man jumps at the sound and decides this wasn't the best idea, so he runs quickly back to the gate, but it is shut and refuses to open.\n\nHe decides to continue on and go find the house on this property. He walks for another 5 minutes before seeing a massive mansion looming in front of him. The front doors must have been 20 feet tall, and there were hundreds of windows and it was 8 stories tall with a tower on the far right side of the house.\n\nThe man slowly walks up the massive stone steps and through the huge pillars and right up to the large wooden doors. He finds the courage to grab the massive lions head knocker and knock on the door. Supprisingly quickly a short man in a butlers uniform opens the door.\n\n\"can I help you?\" asks the butler\n\n\"yes I was looking for a telephone. My car broke down and I don't have cell signal and...\"\n\n\"follow me.\" said the butler, sternly cutting him off.\n\nHe follows the small butler into the largest foyer he has ever seen with rich thick red carpets on the floor and gigantic iron chandeliers hanging from a ceiling so high it reminded him of a Gothic cathedral he had seen many years ago in Italy.\n\nThe butler shows him the telephone and telephone book and leaves him to call the towing company. The towing company is quite busy and because of the distance to his car from any major town, they are not able to send a truck till the next morning.\n\n\"what did they say?\" asked the butler.\n\n\"they can't send a truck till tomorrow. Is there a chance I could mayb...\"\n\n\"Right this way, we have many guest bedrooms.\" says the butler cutting him off again.\n\nHe follows the butler down a long hallway lined with suits of armour and shields with different coats of arms.\n\n\"geez,\" says the man, chuckling to himself, \"do you have talking teacups and a monster for a Master?\"\n\nThe butler responded with silence as he continued to lead him through the mansion. Finally, after what seemed like ages, they reached a lavishly decorated bedroom with a large four post bedroom and a Supprisingly large and modern bathroom.\n\n\"we have a full buffet just down at the end of the hall to your right, but before anything else, I need to show you something.\"\n\nThe butler then takes him back to the main foyer. He walks up to a giant Fireplace. He pushes on a big stone on the corner of the hearth and the back wall of the fireplace slides away to reveal a passage. He walks down this passage turns a corner goes down a set of stairs around another corner, back up some stairs and through a large door with a big brass knob.\n\nIn the middle of the room was a big cage with a pink gorilla sitting in one corner.\n\n\"you must never touch the pink gorilla!\" said the butler as he quickly turned and ushered the man back through the doorway, down the stairs, around the corner, up the stairs, around the corner, down the hallway and out the fireplace.\n\nThe butler then quickly walked away and disappeared through a door that then locked.\n\nNot sure what to think, the man goes back to his room and takes a long shower. After his shower, he goes to bed and tries to sleep, but he can't stop thinking about the pink gorilla. Why would that butler even show him the gorilla? It's not like he would have found the cage by accident.\n\nHe eventually decides he wants to go take another look. not to touch, but just to look. He had been going over the image of that gorilla in his mind and he couldn't decide if what he saw was real or not.\n\nSo he crept out of his room and down to the foyer. The fireplace was closed and he knew he would have to push the secret rock, but he didn't want to alert the butler or anyone else in the house. He tries to carefully push the button, making as little noise as possi...\n\nSHHHOOOK BAM!\n\nHe froze and looked around to see if the loud noise woke anyone. Luckily it seems that no one heard or cared and so he slowly entered through the fireplace and walked slowly down the hallway. He went around the corner at the end of the hallway, down the stairs, around the other corner, up the stairs and then slowly turned the big brass doorknob.\n\nThe door opened with a loud creak and revealed the large cage with the pink gorilla now sitting in a different corner. He slowly walked around the cage untill he was at a point where the gorilla was a mere arms length from the cage bars. The pink gorilla was sitting there snoring, sleeping like a baby. By this time, the man had decided he had to find out what would happen if he touched the gorilla. So he slowly reached in the cage and softly poked the gorilla in the arm. He stood there waiting for the gorilla to react but nothing happened. So he reached out and poked the gorilla a bit harder. This time the gorilla moved to scratch the spot he had touched.\n\nThe gorilla then awoke. Sniffing his arm he uttered a low guttural growl. The man quickly withdrew his arm and headed for the door. The gorilla then released a long loud cry and started going crazy at the bars of the cage. He started actually bending the bars, getting it close to where he could actually get out. Then he ripped one of the bard off and howled again. At this point, the man, terrified, started sprinting out the door. He ran as fast as he could, down the stairs, around the corner, up the stairs. As he reached the top step he could hear the gorilla starting down the stairs behind him. He ran even faster down the hallway and out the fireplace.\n\nHe frantically started mashing the secret stone to get the fireplace to close. And as if in slow motion the back began to slide back in place. It moved so slowly that the man wasn't sure it would close in time. As bit was half closed he saw the gorilla round the last corner. In a mad hope to get it to close faster he started mashing the button again but to no avail.\n\nJust as the massive stone was about to close the gorilla puts his hand in the small Crack left open. He slowly started pulling the large stone wall back open. Terrified, the man ran out the front door and sprinted back down the driveway. He came to the iron gate and again it wouldn't open for him. So he began to climb.\n\nHe got to the top and as he climbed over he heard the gorilla's cry and being so startled he fell down on the other side of the gate tearing his new clothes in the process. He stumbled down the driveway towards the main road and as he looked back he saw the gorilla climbing up the gate.\n\nRunning as hard as he could he ran back to the main road and then back towards his car, the gorilla not far behind. He finally reaches his car exhausted, he tries to start his car but it just won't start. The gorilla running up to the car as he tries again to start the car. The gorilla roars and the man reaches over and pushes down the lock by his shoulder and tries again in vain to start the car.\n\nThe gorilla then starts to push and rock the car, violently shaking the car. He eventually rips off the driver side door. The gorilla then leans down and roars right in the man's cowering head, spewing phlegm all over his face and shoulders. The gorilla then reaches his arm into the car and pokes the man in the shoulder and says,\n\n\"you're it.\"",

A mournful bartender polishes an immaculate glass and halfheartedly waves away a fat, clueless fly.\n\nThe cowboy sidled into a stool and fished a coin out of his pocket. He flicked it with his thumb, and it sang in the air before ringing out on the wooden bar.\n\n\"Say friend, you got a whiskey?\"\n\nThe coin rattles to a stop, and the bartender looks up with a patient smile.\n\n\"That is,\" says the cowboy, \"if you're not too busy.\"\n\n\"No sir,\" says the barman. \"Never too busy.\" He pops the top off a dark bottle of rye and pours a generous glass.\n\nThe cowboy throws it back, licks his lips, and says, \"My, my, my. Doesn't do any good in the bottle, does it?\"\n\n\"I suppose it doesn't,\" says the bartender.\n\nThe fly buzzes by.\n\n\"Well!\" says the cowboy, clearly itching for company. \"Where in the Sam Hell is everybody?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" says the bartender, \"they're all at the hangin'.\"\n\n\"Hangin'?\n\n\"Hangin'.\"\n\nThe cowboy motions for another belt of brown, and the bartender obliges.\n\n\"Now who might they be hangin' today?\"\n\nThe bartender puts his rag on his shoulder, looks the cowboy straight in the eye and says, \"Sir, today they're hangin' none other than 'Brown Paper Pete'.\"\n\n\"Brown Paper Pete?\"\n\n\"The very same.\"\n\nThe cowboy points to the now empty glass and makes the international 'just one more' gesture.\n\n\"That's an interesting name, isn't it?\"\n\n\"It does have an air about it, sir.\"\n\n\"Now why do you suppose they call him that?\"\n\n\"Well sir,\" says the bartender, \"they call him 'Brown Paper Pete' because he wears a brown paper hat.\"\n\n\"Does he now?\"\n\n\"He does.\"\n\n\"And if it rains?\"\n\n\"He wears it all the same.\"\n\n\"My goodness.\"\n\n\"That ain't the half of it, sir!

        "body": "with no memory of how he got there. He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.\n\n\"You're in the afterlife!\" he tells the man, \"But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.\"\n\nAll of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.\n\nThe beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. \"That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.\"\n\nSo the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.\n\n\"What are the odds?\" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. \"That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line.\" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.\n\nWhile he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, \"The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!\"\n\nSadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.\n\nAnd wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. \"Come,\" the beggar told him, \"I'll take you to the evening meal.\" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. \"That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,\" and then he added, \"and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!\"\n\nThe man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. \"What is it,\" he thought, \"that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?\" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.\n\nFifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.\n\nThe beggar laughed jovially. \"I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!\" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.\n\nSmiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. \"That's the line for the dragon meat,\" he said before turning to the next line, \"and that's the line for angeldust stew,\" then he paused, confused.\n\n\"What is it?\" the man asked his old friend.\n\nThe beggar replied, \"There appears to be no punchline.\"\n\nEDIT: if you liked this joke, go to r/feghoot for more like this one!\n\nEDIT 2: To people screaming repost, i gave credit to  u/insolent_swine in the comments.

        "body": "Once upon a time, there was a prince of a certain land, who wanted to be a lowly fisherman when he grew up. But try as he could, he couldn't ever catch a single fish. He had tried many methods, including nets, spears, and traps, but all to no avail.\n\nFurthermore, he was looked down upon by the rest of his family. While he should have been heir to the throne, he spent so much time trying to fish and failing that he was unsuited to the position. Furthermore, he had hardly wanted to become king anyway, and saw no real need for him to fill the position. Eventually, his family disowned him and he had to live his own life in a small hut.\n\nOne day, he met an old man by the lake shore, who was hungry and begging. The prince was down to his last few coins in his purse, but he gave them to the old man anyway. Not entirely out of altruism, mind you. He simply thought the old man would be able to have more use with the money than he would, considering what a failure he was at fishing.\n\nThe old man looked up at him and smiled, asking him \"I see you have a fishing net. Would you like to learn the secret to fishing?\"\n\nThe prince, obviously just having given away absolutely everything, had little choice but to agree. So obviously, he did.\n\nThe old man told him, \"Come closer.\"\n\nThe prince did so.\n\nThe old man whispered in his ear, \"Beyond the desert to the east is a huge ocean where the water is sweet and bubbling. Many fish swim in it, for there are plenty of nutrients in the water. You will surely get some fish there.\"\n\nThe prince said, \"I understand,\" and started to set off.\n\nThe old man called after him, \"Wait, you'll need this!\" and gave the prince a fishing pole.\n\n\"This fishing pole is enchanted. It will draw fish towards it. You'll see.\"\n\nThe prince scrounged up what he could for the journey. He took the last of the bread he had, some water from the lake, and left his hut abandoned.\n\nHe started crossing the desert. The blistering heat beat down on him. Halfway through the desert, he noticed someone was following him. He turned towards them and asked if they had brought any water with them.\n\n\"Yes, but you haven't kept up your interest payments. Pay me and I'll throw in the water as a free bonus. Otherwise, I guess you won't be needing your left hand.\"\n\nTrue to the old man's word, the fishing rod had indeed attracted a loan-shark (though the prince didn't realize this at the time). Not wanting to be killed or tortured or whatnot, the prince quickly thought up a plan.\n\n\"Yes, it's right here,\" he said, rummaging through his bag.\n\nHe took out the stale bread, which had hardened to a brick, and threw it at the shark, stunning him for a moment.\n\nHe turned and fled, running through the desert. His throat was parching, and every step he took against the slippery sands seemed to resist him all the way. Meanwhile, the loan-shark was calmly walking towards him.\n\nSomehow, the prince managed to outrun the loan-shark. He made it to the edge of the bubbling ocean, as the old man had predicted. There, he saw a boat with some fishing supplies in them. He climbed in and started to figure out how to use the fishing rod.\n\nTrue to the old man's word, the moment he cast his hook into the bubbling, fizzy waters, strange fish did indeed start biting almost immediately. He ended pulling fish after fish after hefty fish into his boat; so much so that he almost capsized. But in the end, he rowed back to shore, and thought that he should set up his home here.\n\nHe built a fire, cooked one of the fish, and took a bite out of it.\n\nIt was the most delicious thing he had ever tasted.\n\nSeveral months passed, and the prince was able to live a happy life. Many travellers who passed by enjoyed his fish and paid a high price for it. So much so, that he eventually started up a trading company specializing in the fish. Then people wanted to be employed, so he had to build houses for them too. The prince's company soon turned into a town, into a city, and he had almost supreme authority.\n\nOne day, however, the aforementioned loan-shark arrived at the new palace. He was shown the way to the prince (who was basically now king but didn't realize it), and said \"Now that you're king, you can pay me all that money you owed! Remember, of course that the rate was normally 8% per month, but since you're a king, it's 8% per day!\"\n\nThe prince, realizing what had happened, fell to his knees and cried:\n\n\"Is this the reel life? Is this just Fanta sea?\nCaught in sand, lied; no escape from regality\"",

Do you think I could stay the night?\"\n\nThe monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a beautiful sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.\n\nThe next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, \"We can't tell you. You're not a monk.\" Distraught, the man is forced to leave.\n\nYears later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.\n\nThe monks reply, \"We can't tell you. You're not a monk.\"\nThe man says, \"If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.\"\n\nThe monks reply, \"You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.\"\n\nThe man sets about his task. \n\nAfter years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.\n\n\"In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.\"\n\nThe monks reply, \"Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.\"\n\nThe monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, \"The sound is beyond that door.\"\n\nThe monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.\n\nFinally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, \"This is the last key to the last door.\"\n\nThe man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door!\nWith trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound......\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\nBut, of course, I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.",

But the weight was still piling on and getting worse. So even though it was making me sick I forced myself to eat a few spoonfuls a day, and eventually worked it up to two sticks a day. I got diarrhea regularly and I thought maybe it was working, but the scale and mirror told me it wasn't. Around six months in something changed in my body, and I stopped getting sick. Eating butter started to feel really comforting. I thought it was good, but the fat kept coming.\n\nThen I'm crying about the weight a few days later, so I go back to the friend's post, and it actually said...\n\n\"Eat better.\"",

She wanted to open a savings account and insisted on talking to the president of the Bank because, she said, she had a lot of money.\n \nAfter many lengthy discussions (after all, the client is always right) an employee took the elderly woman to the president's office.\n \nThe president of the Bank asked her how much she wanted to deposit. She placed her purse on his desk and replied, '$165,000'.\n \nThe president was curious and asked her how she had been able to save so much money. The elderly woman replied that she made bets.\n \nThe president was surprised and asked, 'What kind of bets?'\n \nThe elderly woman replied, 'Well, I bet you $25,000 that your testicles are square.'\n \nThe president started to laugh and told the woman that it was impossible to win a bet like that.         \nThe woman never batted an eye. She just looked at the president and said, 'Would you like to take my bet?'\n \n'Certainly', replied the president. 'I bet you $25,000 that my testicles are not square.'\n \n'Done', the elderly woman answered. 'But given the amount of money involved, if you don't mind I would like to come back at 10 ' clock tomorrow morning with my lawyer as a witness.' 'No problem', said the president of the Bank confidently.\n \nThat night, the president became very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of the mirror examining his testicles, turning them this way and that, checking them over again and again until he was positive that no one could consider his testicles as square and reassuring himself that there was no way he could lose the bet.\n \nThe next morning at exactly 10 o'clock the elderly woman arrived at the president's office with her lawyer and acknowledged the $25,000 bet made the day before that the president's testicles were square.\n \nThe president confirmed that the bet was the same as the one made the day before. Then the elderly woman asked him to drop his pants etc. so that she and her lawyer could see clearly.\n \nThe president was happy to oblige.\n \nThe elderly woman came closer so she could see better and asked   the president if she could touch them. 'Of course', said the president. 'Given the amount of money involved, you should be 100% sure.'\n \nThe elderly woman did so with a little smile. Suddenly the president noticed that the lawyer was banging his head against the wall. He asked the elderly woman why he was doing that and she replied, 'Oh, it's probably because I bet him $100,000 that around 10 o'clock in the morning I would be holding the balls of the President of the Royal Bank of Ireland.'",

On their way to the venue the Pope rolls down the privacy glass in the limo and says to his chauffeur, \"Hey, you know what? I've always rode in these things, but I've never driven one! Do you mind if we switch spots?\" Being it was the Pope himself, the chauffeur felt he couldn't say no so he obliged and exchanged seats.\nIt had been years since the Pope had driven, and he was having the time of his life cruising down the interstate going over 100mph! Consequently he was clocked by a state trooper and pulled over. As the trooper approached the vehicle and got a glance at the driver he quickly turned around and returned to his squad car to call his supervisor. \n\nThe trooper called in and told the sergeant, \"Sergeant, I'm afraid I pulled over someone very very important.\"\nIn which he replied,\" Well, who is it, the governor?\"\n\"No, no, much more important than that!\"\n\"The President?!\"\n\"I'm afraid even more important than that!\"\n\"Well, who the hell is it then?!\" \n\"I don't know, but his chauffeur is the freakin' Pope!\"",

There is only one serving per day because there is only one bull fight each morning. If you come early and place your order, we will be sure to save you this delicacy.\"\n\nThe next morning, the cowboy returned, placed his order, and that evening was served the one and only special delicacy of the day\n\nAfter a few bites, inspecting his platter, he called to the waiter and said, \"These are delicious, but they are much, much smaller than the ones I saw you serve yesterday.\"\n\nThe waiter shrugged his shoulders and replied, \"Si, Se\u00f1or.
