He's got good looks, money, a luxurious loft apartment, and a convertible sports car. You can be sure that all of the ladies want him, but of all the things he has, there is one thing that he just wasn't happy with: the size of his penis. \n\nJohn decides he has enough money to get a penis enlargement. I mean, if a woman can get her barely an A mosquito bites exploded into bodacious DD tatas, then why can't he go from teenage Asian to Mandingo? \n\nSo John makes an appointment to see a penis enlargement specialist. \n\nAfter waiting a few days he finally gets into his appointment he has been so anxious about. The surgeon asks: \"So what can I do for you today John?\" to which John replies \"Y'know doc, I'm just not too happy with the size of my penis. It's kind of... ^small.\" The doctor thinks for a minute and then says: \"Well, John, unfortunately I'm fresh out of penises at the moment. We won't really be able to do anything for you until I get my next shipment in a couple months.\" John seems devastated. He can't believe that he has to go on this date knowing this girl will laugh as soon as she catches a glimpse of his little Vienna sausage. He begs the doctor: \"Please! There has to be *something* you can do to help me. I'm begging you!\" The doctor responds: \"Hmm.. give me just a moment.\" He walks out of the room, and returns a few minutes later. \"I have potential good news for you John, but I'm not sure if you're going to be up for it. You see, I'm fresh out of penises, but I *do* have this baby elephant trunk. I know it's a bit odd, but it will make Mandingo looks like a little school boy.\" John thinks for a minute, and decides it isn't such a bad idea. \"Anything is better than what I'm packing right now.\" John says.\n\nJohn schedules the procedure, and ends up recovering a few days before his date. \n\nThe big day comes, and John is more confident than ever. He picks her up in the roadster, makes undeniably confident eye contact, and is making her laugh all the way to the restaurant. Really, everything has been going beautifully. They arrive at a *fancy* restaurant, valet parks his car, and they are seated immediately. A minute later the waiter comes with a basket of bread rolls, places them on the table, and asks what they would like to drink. John orders them both the most expensive bottle of wine they had. The waiter leaves to retrieve the wine while John and his beautiful date look over the menu. John tells her that she can have *anything* she'd like. \"Don't even look at the pricing, money isn't an issue.\" he says. The waiter returns with the wine, and they place their order. While waiting for their food they decide to dig into the rolls. They both get a roll, butter it, and begin eating. Everything seems dandy, and then out of **nowhere** a baby elephant trunk **SHOOTS** up from under the table, grabs a roll, and disappears. John's date was **amazed**. \"**WOAH!** Can you do that again?!\" she said. To which he replied:\n\n\"I can, but I don't think I could fit another roll up my ass.\"\n\n",

The alarm went out to all the fire departments for miles around.\nWhen the volunteer fire fighters appeared on the scene, the chemical company president rushed to the fire chief and said, \"All our secret formulas are in the vault in the centre of the plant. They must be saved. I will give $50,000 to the fire department that brings them out intact.\"\n\nBut the roaring flames held the fire fighters off.\n\nSoon more fire departments had to be called in as the situation became desperate. As the firemen arrived, the president shouted out that the offer was now $100,000 to the fire department that could bring out the company's secret files.\n\nFrom the distance, a lone siren was heard as another fire truck came into sight. It was the nearby Norwegian rural township volunteer fire company composed mainly of Norwegians over the age of 65. To everyone's amazement, that little run-down fire engine roared right past all the large newer fire trucks that were parked around the plant.\n\nWithout even slowing down, the old truck drove straight into the middle of the inferno. Outside, the other fire\nfighters watched as the Norwegian old timers jumped off right in the middle of the fire and fought it back on all sides. It was a performance and effort never seen before.\n\nWithin a short time, the Norske old timers had the fire well under control and had saved the secret formulas. The grateful chemical company president announced that for such a superhuman feat he was upping the reward to $200,000, and walked over to personally thank each of the brave fire fighters.\n\nThe local TV news reporter rushed in to capture the event on film, asking their chief, \"What are you going to do with all that money?\"\n\n\"Vell,\" said Ole Larsen, the 70-year-old fire chief, \"Da first thing ve gonna do is fix da brakes on dat focking truck!\"",

We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big, high-end department store. I walked around with her while she tried on several very expensive outfits. She couldn't decide which one to take so I told her we'd just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so I said lets get a pair for each outfit. We went on to the jewellery department where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings.\n\nLet me tell you...she was so excited. She must have thought I was one wave short of a tsunami. I started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn't even know how to play tennis. But, I think I threw her for a loop when I said, \"That's fine, honey.\"\n\nShe appeared to be almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement.

It serves, therefore, as a valuable cautionary tale.\n\nThe first flaw in the anecdote\u2019s construction is in its gratuitous use of ethnicity as a crutch. To be sure, Jews serve as an invaluable comedy resource. Any joke involving miserliness of any kind can be improved by the addition of a Hebraic surname (or, in the alternative, by the addition of the prefix \u201cMac.\u201d) But here, \u201cJewishness\u201d does not improve the comedy one wit. Any ethnicity will scream when placed in an oven. You throw an Irishman into an oven, and see if he doesn\u2019t cry out \u201cBegosh and begorrah, I\u2019ve been thrown into an oven!\u201d So too the Mexican, whose refrain of \u201cAi yi yi, es mui caliente!\u201d is equally plausible. Indeed, the only person who should ever be thrown into an oven in comedy is Sylvia Plath.\n\nMany of you may object, \u201cBut what of the Holocaust? Surely that validates the choice of \u2018Jew\u2019 in the set-up?\u201d\n\nFar from it. One must be very careful when relying on history as validation. The Nazis threw very few screaming Jews into the oven. This is not Holocaust revisionism, it\u2019s simply fact. The Germans are a very efficient people, and they killed almost all their victims before disposing of their bodies in factory-like furnaces. To do otherwise would slow their production lines of death down, and that would be intolerable to the German psyche. No, no. The corpses that were thrown into the ovens went in not unlike the aforementioned pizza \u2013 silently.\n\nThus, the fundamental logic of the joke is ruined. The difference does not hold up under historical scrutiny. \n\nSo when you are asked to contemplate the difference between a Jew and a pizza, plausible answer is: \u201cOne is a human being with a human soul and a human mind and inherent human dignity, and the other is a molded dough product.\u201d Or \u201cYou take the pizza out of the oven in one piece.\u201d\n\n",

She told the cop the whole story about the magic dildo and how she couldn't get it out of her. \n\nThe cop laughed and said \"magic dildo my ass!\"",

One cold winter's morning he was walking along a country road, when he heard a cry for help from a nearby lake.\n\nWithout a moment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to a little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for a car to flag down.\n\nCoincidentally the father drives up. \"How can I ever thank you sir?\" he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. \"Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.\"\n\n\"Ah, well...\" stammers the tramp, \"... uh, I'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out.\"\n\n\"Oh dear,\" says the father, \"I don't carry much cash with me, I only have ten pounds - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe.\"\n\n\"No! No!\" says the tramp, \"Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.\"\n\n\"Ten pounds,\" thinks the tramp, \"I'm rich! I'm rich!\" and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.\n\nHe finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. \"I'll have one holiday please!\"\n\n\"Ahem, which holiday would sir like?\" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.\n\n\"Oh, any holiday I don't mind, anything up to ten pounds,\" replies the tramp.\n\n\"TEN POUNDS! You'll NEVER get a holiday for ten pounds,\" says the girl incredulously.\n\nShe goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.\n\n\"Well you'll never believe it,\" she says to the tramp, back in the shop. \"I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.\"\n\n\"Yippee!\" exclaims the tramp, \"I'll take it!\"\n\nA few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.\n\n\"Get off my ship ye dirty bum!\" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.\n\n\"But I've got my ticket!\", responds the tramp, \"super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!\"\n\n\"Well okay,\" says the captain, \"but you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.\"\n\nSo the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.\n\n\"Psst,\" says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.\n\n\"Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.\"\n\nThe tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!\n\nFirst they went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets - 6\" pile. A genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.\n\nThen the second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3\" deep, and so on...\n\n3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.\n\n\"Sheer luxury!\" exclaimed the tramp, \"A room of my very own.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you like it,\" replies the captain, \"but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.\"\n\nWell the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...\n\nThen one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.\n\nHe climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...\n\n... and what a dive...!\n\nPerfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.\n\nNow unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.\n\n\"That was amazing!\" exclaimed the captain, \"Where did you learn to dive like that?\"\n\n\"Um, well I've never actually dived before,\" replied the tramp.\n\n\"Well that's incredible!\" says the captain, \"I've never seen...\" He broke off. \"Hey, I've got an idea\", he started again. \"How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!\"\n\n\"It's a deal!\" says our man. For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.\n\nThen one morning the captain comes to talk. \"Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" agreed the tramp.\n\nTwo days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.\n\n\"Well, tramp,\" said the captain, shaking his hand, \"Let's see what you can do.\" And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...\n\nup and up...\n\nbelow him the ship grew smaller...\n\non and on...\n\npast a solitary albatross...\n\nand still higher...\n\ntill the ship was but a speck on the ocean below...\n\nand on still further...\n\n/ till the ocean grew dim...\n\nand the earth itself...\n\nbegan to shrink...\n\npast our moon...\n\nand on...\n\nand Mars...\n\nand on...\n\nhigher, and higher...\n\nthrough the asteroid belt...\n\nand on and on towards the diving board...\n\npast the outer planets, until...\n\non the outermost reaches of the Solar System...\n\nhe reached the board.\n\nHe climbed on top and radioed the captain...\n\nand then...\n\n.'

That was the most *STUPENDOUS* piece of diving I have ever seen.\"\n\nThe tramp blushed.\n\nThe captain went on, \"but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.\"\n\nAnd the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: \"Well you see...\n\nI'm a just poor tramp...\n\nso you must understand...\n\nI've been through many a hard ship in my life.\"\n",

Well, his mom was shocked and dropped the dishes she had in hand. She looked at him and exclaimed \"Little Bobby - YOU CAN TALK?!?!\", and the boy replied \"yeah\". She was quiet for a moment as the realization sunk in, and then asked \"well, why haven't you said anything your whole life up until now?\".\n\n--\n\nHe said \"everything has been fine 'til now\".",

        "body": "...down a rural country road. It was a gorgeous sight against the red and orange sunset. He had been riding for about an hour and passed all sorts of country sights. A tractor in a field. Cows grazing. A canopy tunnel of trees. And different novelty mailboxes including a bright pink one. . Suddenly a downpour came upon him. The sudden rain made the roads very slippery and he wound up laying the bike over in a ditch. This caused some parts to come loose and hoses break. He reached for his phone but  it was soaked and unable to turn on after the accident.\n\nStranded and alone, he decided to walk down the road back the way he came. The pink mailbox was less than a mile away and he figured there was a house nearby. As he finally started to reach the pink mailbox, he noticed there were pink flowers planted around it. He thought nothing of it and made his way down the long now-muddy road. After a few minutes he came upon a huge pink gate with pink railings and a pink call box.\n\nThe man rang the pink box and a pink tinted screen came on with an old lady answering,\u201cHello?\u201d\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d said the man. \u201cI\u2019ve been riding down the road and had an accident. Would it be alright if I came in and used your phone? My cell phone is soaked.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course!\u201d said the old woman. And the huge pink gate gave a creak as it opened up.\n\nThe man walked through the huge pink gate and walked up to her house. It was a massive, 3-story, colonial style house with a porch that wrapped completely around. And it was all pink. The house had pink bushes planted in front. Pink steps with pink banisters led up to the pink porch with pink rocking chairs and pink ceiling fans. He walked up and rang the pink doorbell which gave out a very bright and pleasant \u201cding.\u201d \n\nThe large pink front door opened up and the old woman greeted him with a smile. She was wearing a pink nightgown and pink slippers.\n\n\u201cPlease, come in,\u201d she said, and motioned her little hand inside.\n\nAs the man stepped inside, his jaw dropped. Every single thing inside the house was pink. The tile on the floor was two-toned, checkerboard style pink. The curtains we pink with pink embroidery embellishments. Even the frames on the windows were pink. He took a step and started to take his muddy boots off when he noticed the pink umbrella holder and pink coat rack. \n\n\u201cYou are soaked to the bone! Would you like a towel to dry off?\u201d asked the little pink woman.\n\n\u201cYes, please,\u201d answered the man.\n\n\u201cGo into the kitchen. The telephone is in there,\u201d she instructed, as she went into another room.\n\nThe man made his way across the entry room into the kitchen. His hand lightly swept across the pink dresser, along the pink walls and pink trim, down the pink door frame, and to the small pink dining table. He sat in a pink chair and picked up the pink rotary phone. Even the telephone wire was pink. He attempted to dial a number but the phone seemed to be disconnected.\n\nThe little pink lady came in with a large pink towel and handed it to the man. It was warm as if it had just come out of the clothes dryer.\n\n\u201cThank you so much,\u201d said the man. \u201cBut I think your phone is disconnected because of the storm.\u201d\n\nThe pink lady responded,\u201dOh, that\u2019s a shame. Well, if you need to you can stay in one of the guest bedrooms for the night.\u201d\n\nThe man thanked her for her kindness and made his way up the pink stairs, holding onto the pink banister. He walked down the pink hallway with pink wallpaper. He walked into a bedroom and found it to be completely pink. On the pink bed were some pink pajamas, a pink robe, another pink towel, and a pink travel toothbrush wrapped in plastic. He took the pink towel, pink robe, and pink toothbrush and went to the bathroom to wash up before bed.\n\nIn the bathroom, the man undressed and used the pink soap and pink shampoo to wash himself. Then he dried himself with the pink towel and put on the pink robe. He used the pink sink to brush his teeth with the pink toothbrush with the pink toothpaste that was already in the pink bathroom.\n\nHe then went back into the pink bedroom and changed into his pink pajamas. He laid down on the bed and covered himself with the pink blanket and pink sheet. Then, laying his head down on the pink pillow, he fell right to sleep.\n\nIn the morning, the man woke up and made his way downstairs. In the hallway, he ran into two other men. They introduced themselves and explained to each other why they were there. One man had slid into a ditch near the motorcycle accident and lost his phone. The other man was the pink lady\u2019s nephew who came in earlier that morning. \n\nAfter making their way down, they came upon the little old lady was already dressed in a pink top and pink pants with little pink shoes. She was carrying the man\u2019s clothes and asked the gentlemen if they would like breakfast.\n\n\u201cWould you like bacon and eggs or oatmeal?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have oatmeal, Auntie.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have bacon and eggs,\u201d said the man in the car accident.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have bacon and eggs, as well,\u201d said the man in the motorcycle accident.\n\n\u201cVery good,\u201d said the little pink lady. \n\nShe made the breakfast with her pink cooking utensils and pink pots and pans. The bacon sizzled and steam rose into the pink vent. She took out some pink plates and pink silverware and set them on the table where the men were seated. She brought down some pink glasses and poured each man some strawberry milk.\n\nThey all ate and were satisfied with their breakfast. The man tried the phone again and it was working. He called his wife and asked her to come pick him up. The man in the car accident used the phone and asked his roommate to pick him up.\n\nA few hours later, the wife and the roommate both show up and pick up their respective husband and friend. And they all lived happily ever after.\n\nThere is one conclusion we can take from this story.\n\nTwo out of three men prefer bacon and eggs over oatmeal.",

Tonight while your wife is making dinner in the kitchen, go into the bedroom and ask her what's for dinner. If she doesn't hear you, go into the living room and ask again. If she doesn't hear you while you're in the living room, go into the dining room and ask a third time. If she still can't hear you even from the dining room, go into the kitchen and ask one more time. If she can't hear you while you're in the kitchen, then she must be losing her hearing.\"\n\nSo the man took the doctor's advice and tested it out on his wife that night. First, he went into the bedroom and called out to his wife, \"Honey, what's for dinner?\" No response. So he moved into the living room. He called out again, \"Honey, what's for dinner?\" No response. So he moved again, this time into the dining room. \"Honey what's for dinner?\" Still no response. So finally, he moved into the kitchen where his wife was making dinner and asked once more, \"Honey, what's for dinner?\" His wife turned to look at him with an angry look on her face and said, \"Chicken.

Mr. Pott left the office, and as soon as he got into his car, his skin got all red and puffy. \n\nHe called the doctor the next day, and said that it happened again as soon as he got into his car, and asked if he could come back into the office. The doctor said sure, since he wasn't busy that day.\n\nAgain Mr. Pott and the doctor waited to witness the described symptoms, but again, nothing happened all day. \n\nThat night, as Mr. Pott was getting into his car, he broke out in a rash almost instantly. \n\nMr. Pott again called the doctor and asked to come in. \n\nEvery day Mr. Pott would go see the doctor. This went on for days, weeks, and finally months, to no avail. \n\nIn fact, the doctor never did see the odd skin condition, because a watched Pott never boils. \n\nEdit: A name",

He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Muslim community. If the Muslims won, they could stay in Italy; and if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.\n\nThe Muslim people met and picked an aged and wise Mufti to represent them in the debate. However, as the Mufti didn't speak Italian, and the Pope didn't speak Arabic, they agreed that it would be a \"silent\" debate.\n\nOn the chosen day the Pope and Mufti sat opposite each other. The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers. The Mufti looked back and raised one finger. Next, the Pope waved his fingers around his head. The Mufti pointed to the ground where he sat. The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine. The Mufti pulled out an apple. With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Moulana was too clever. The Muslims could stay in Italy.\n\nLater the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, \"First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God! Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us. I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin. He beat me at every move and I could not continue!\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Muslim community gathered to ask the Mufti how he'd won. \"I haven't a clue,\" the Mufti said. \"First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him as they call it 'the finger.' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Muslims and I told him that we were staying right here!\" \"And then what?\" asked a woman. \"Who knows?\" said the Mufti. \"He took out his lunch so I took out mine.\"\n\nEdit: First time I heard this joke was around a year ago, but I had never heard the Jewish one until shortly after. So yeah, I'm well aware it's a repost, but, obviously by the votes, not that many people heard it the first time around (or second, third...fifth...twenty-second...etc.) so thank you, but it has already been pointed out.",

One of them manages to convince Paul, in his drunk state, that anything is edible when combined with enough potatoes and pastry. Paul thinks that this is the most amazing thing he's ever heard, and runs home to test it. After getting home, he looks around for non-food items to eat with potatoes, and eventually settles on the idea of trying to eat a Biro.\n\nSo he smashes the Biro into small pieces, combines it with a few potatoes, puts the mixture in a savoury pastry, and bakes it for a while. After it's baked, he's slightly less drunk and realises it's not such a great idea to try and eat a Biro, but he knows his friends won't let him forget it if he reneges on his commitment, so he eats it anyway. It takes him a while, and by the time he's finished he feels tired from chewing and wants to wait for the potato to digest, so he decides to try and sleep for a while.\n\nWhile he's half sleeping and half just lying there, Paul - predictably enough - is thinking about Biros, and has a brainwave. His company can put their logo on anything and double the price, right? So why not start selling incredibly expensive writing implements? He writes this down in a fit of genius and takes it into the office the next day. He tells his manager about the idea, who then tells their own manager, and so on and so on. Apparently, someone at the top liked the idea, because the following month, Tim Cook calls a press conference to introduce his new product.\n\nTim walks up onto the stage holding a long, thin object. A larger picture comes up on screen - it's a Biro, but it's made of a light grey plastic and has the company logo on it. Tim announces that the stylish new design is going to be called the *iWrite*, and that it will cost $150 at launch.\n\nHowever, to this day, within that office, it's still referred to by everyone who knows its origin as *pen-pie-nap Paul's Apple pen*.",

You\u2019re not a monk.\u201dThe man says, \u201cAll right, all right. I\u2019m *dying* to know.

When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.\u201dThe man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, \u201cI have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.\u201dThe monks reply, \u201cCongratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.\u201dThe monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, \u201cThe sound is right behind that door.\u201dThe man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, \u201cReal funny. May I have the key?\u201dThe monks give him the key, and he opens the door.Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.The man demands the key to the stone door.The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.Finally, the monks say, \u201cThis is the last key to the last door.\u201dThe man is relieved to no end.He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.But I can't tell you because you're not a monk.",

The challenge was for someone to get the elephant to take all four feet off the ground at once without using any device that would actually lift the elephant from the ground such as a crane, hoist, or the like, if successful they would receive a 10,000 dollar cash prize, but the catch was they had to pay 100 dollars to try.\n\nTurned out people came from far and wide, even other countries. Everyone tried everything they could from coaxing to hypnosis to threats, but try as they might everyone failed in their attempt. \n\nFrank was elated, his scheme was working brilliantly and he was making some nice dough.\n\nOne day a blue convertible pulled into the driveway and a man in a leather jacket got out and approached Frank.\n\n\"Good afternoon sir, Is it true that if I can get your elephant to take all his feet off the ground at once I'll win 10,000 dollars?\"\n\nFrank replied. \"Good afternoon to you too sir, yes it is true, but you have to pay 100 dollars per attempt.\"\n\nThe man nodded and agreed. He gave Frank the 100 dollars, walked over to his vehicle and opened the trunk. He pulled out an old fashioned wooden Louisville Slugger baseball bat and walked up and looked the elephant in the eye. \n\nA few moments later he walked around behind the elephant, took a stable stance and took a home run swing at the elephants testicles that would have made the Babe proud. The elephant trumpeted out and jumped into the air taking all four feet off the ground. \n\nFrank stood with his mouth gaping open and reluctantly handed the 10 000 dollars to the stranger. The man got into his car and drove off.\n\nA few months later Frank began to get low on funds again. Although his challenge had been won, he had still made a good profit. \n\nBut now he began to try and think of another scam to make even more money, this time, find one that couldn't be accomplished.\nSo Frank came up with a new challenge and once again put it in the newspapers and on T.V. \n\nThis time he was sure of his challenge. He had seen elephants move their heads up and down but because of their anatomy they couldn't move it from left to right, only twist it left and right. Once again a 10,000 dollar prize was offered, and a 100 dollar fee to try.\n\nSo once again people came from far and wide, again even from other countries. Again everything from coaxing to hypnosis to threats were employed but all those who tried failed in their attempt.\n\nOne day a familiar blue convertible pulled into the driveway and a man in a leather jacket got out and approached Frank.\n\n\"Good afternoon sir. Is it true that if I can get your elephant to move his head from left to right, I'll win 10,000 dollars?\"\n\nFrank swallowed hard and replied. \"Afternoon sir, yes it is true but you have to pay 100 dollars per attempt.\"\n\nOnce again the man nodded and agreed. He handed Frank the 100 dollars and once again walked over to his vehicle and opened the trunk. He pulled out the same wooden Louisville Slugger baseball bat, still stained with the elephants blood from the first encounter and walked up to the elephant.\n\nHe paused and looked the elephant in the eye, a few moments later he asked. \"Remember me?\"\n\nThe elephant nodded it's head up and down \"Yes.\"\n\n\"Want me to do it again?\"\n\nThe elephant shook it's head from left to right. \"No.\"",

        "body": "Hey, my name\u2019s Mike Doe, and this is my story. I had a friend in college, my freshman roommate, who was always talking about his family. His name was Robert Gooding, and he must\u2019ve had a family tree that started from Adam and Eve. Every single day he would drone on and on about some cousin or uncle or some such. He would always burst into the room saying things like, \u201cHey Mike! You\u2019ll never guess Uncle Nate and Aunt Ridley are doing in Taiwan for the orphans this week!\u201d I remember him talking about how Dimitri, his mother\u2019s grandfather\u2019s nephew\u2019s son, which is apparently what second cousin once removed means, had resolved a tense hostage situation in Iran. And how cool Auntie Pauline (actually a distant cousin) was for working on top secret stuff with the CIA. I always tried to be patient with him and at least pretended to listen and nod at his stories. They never seemed to be about the same people. Sometimes he\u2019d mention something that was actually funny or interesting too so it wasn\u2019t always bad.\n\nGood old rambling Robert. He picked up that nickname within a couple weeks of starting school--I don\u2019t think he liked it much. He didn\u2019t make many friends because he could never stop talking about his own family. Sometimes I think that I was the only one he could talk to who wouldn\u2019t start running after five minutes. I\u2019m not going to lie though. Back then I endeavored to be out of the room most of the day to avoid his ramblings. However no matter how late I came back, he was always up and ready to tell me something new about his family\u2019s latest adventures.\n\nThere was this one time that was different though. On a day close to the end of our first semester together, he suddenly stopped his rambling and stared at me with a really serious expression. The abrupt lack of background noise startled me from the article I was reading while humoring him, and when I saw his face I thought he must have been angry with me for ignoring him. \u201cYou know Michael,\u201d he started as I prepared my apology, \u201cI really appreciate that you listen to my stories every day. I know it must be boring and annoying for you, but you listen anyway and I appreciate that. So I want to promise you something. Us Goodings, we don\u2019t forget stuff like this. We take care of our friends. Just you wait, one day me and the whole family will find a way to thank you.\u201d I shuddered at the thought of having to attend a graduation party with his entire family and hear about all their adventures first hand, but at that moment I realized that Robert was actually a pretty good guy.\n\nOur year together came to an end, and the next year I was assigned a different roommate. Rambling Robert still sent me emails to keep me up to date with all his family happenings for a while, but even those stopped when he decided to transfer out to some college in Washington. I completed my degree in criminal psychology and went on to work as a detective for the DEA for a while. I had a great time there busting drug dealers and cleaning up the streets of my hometown, and my mom was so proud to have a real Officer Doe in the family. I was about 45 years old when they promoted me and had me relocated near the Mexican border to work on the drug traffic coming from the cartels. It was there that I finally met one of Robert\u2019s infamous family members, Randall Gooding. He was my new supervisor, and when I showed up on the first day he greeted me like an old friend. He told me that he recognized my name and background from the stories Robert had told him, and he personally requested that I be sent down. I was surprised that Robert even talked about me, we had only known each other for a year, but it was nice to reminisce about the Goodings again. Randall was just as talkative as Robert was, and we hit it off almost immediately. It felt like I was in college again. His nickname around the office was Rambling Randy, which had me chuckling for at least a day. Robert, it turns out, was doing just fine. He was a doctor now somewhere in Texas, and I was happy that my old friend was able to make such a good life for himself.\n\nWork was good for a few years until the cartel activity started to pick up dramatically. Nobody was sure why but we were suddenly inundated with arrests and busts and all kinds of paper work. Even Randy wasn\u2019t as talkative around this time. It was all supposed to come to a head today. Today we were going to do a massive takedown on a processing plant operating just inside the border. Our undercover agent had uncovered it while posing for a different case so Randy and I took the lead while the rest of the office continued monitoring the other operation. We enlisted the FBI and local SWAT teams for help and I thought everything was going to go smoothly until I got kidnapped right out of the parking lot on my way out of the office last night.\n\nFrom the time they ripped the rucksack bag off of my head till the first rays of daylight, they questioned me. They were careful. All of them had clown masks on, the hard plastic kind that never quite fit the face right. All of them were wearing gloves and carrying weapons--some had guns, some had various wicked modifications of baseball bats and crowbars. The night was rough. They wanted to know how we found out about them, who we were working with, when the operation was going to go down, and a whole host of other questions. I was patient and waited. I gave them no information and suffered a few broken ribs and some teeth for it. While they were questioning me, I took in my surroundings. I knew from the floor plans I had studied for the bust that I was in the processing plant, specifically in one of the raised offices at the end of the building. I could see the entire plant from the large window on the wall in front of me. I guessed that they did not know about our plans yet, so I contented myself to sit tight and wait for the bust to happen at 10AM.\n\nHowever, it was around 6AM when I heard the sirens blaring in the distance.\u00a0Maybe they stepped up the schedule when they found out I was kidnapped, I thought. My captors were awake in an instant and took up the preplanned positions we had predicted. One of the guys carrying what looked like an M16 came cursing into the office where I was being held. After cracking me in the face with the butt of the gun, I felt more than heard him raise the muzzle level with the back of my head. Soon I heard an unfamiliar voice yell over a megaphone giving the normal spiel about being surrounded and to give up. Of course they refused to give up and began to use me as a bargaining chip. Randy\u2019s voice came over the megaphone just before the first officer continued the negotiation, \u201cMikey! Just wait Mikey! Hang tight and don\u2019t do anything stupid.\u201d\n\nThe standoff lasted for hours. If it weren\u2019t for the gun pressed on the nape of my neck, I would have probably passed out from boredom. Eventually things got real quiet. My guard started getting antsy and walked out--probably to check for new orders with his superiors. As soon as he left the room, a hundred glass windows shattered breaking the silence and raining shards of glass down on the main factory floor. White smoke obscured the first floor as tear gas flooded the facility. Shouting and gunfire followed as my captors opened fire. Amid the confusion and smoke I couldn\u2019t tell who was winning. I did hear Randy\u2019s voice at one point yelling orders like, \u201cDimitri, take the stairs and give Pauline some cover.\u201d None of the officers who were supposed to be with us today were named Dimitri or Pauline. The din began to wither after only a few minutes and unseen officers began yelling, \u201cClear!\u201d As the smoke dissipated, I expected to see the body armor and face masks of the SWAT teams who were supposed to be part of today\u2019s operation. Instead I saw lots of men and a few women I had never seen before in various uniforms. Some were in army uniforms others were in suits, and there were even a few in civilian clothes.\u00a0God, did they call the Army and CIA in on this?\u00a0When Randy saw me, he came running up with one of the suited men who was carrying a bag.\n\n\u201cMike! Thank God you\u2019re still alive. I\u2019m sorry we made you wait so long, but we had to wait for all the flights to make it before we could move.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? What flights? Randy, what are you talking about?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe found out you were kidnapped at about midnight. The team that we were going to use wasn\u2019t trained for hostage situations so I had to improvise. I made some calls around and got as many as I could to come down here. Good thing Nate here happened to have hostage experience. Nobody asked any questions after I brought your name up, we all know you thanks to Robert here.\u201d He motioned at the suited man who was leaning in to assess me.\n\nI frowned at the man and suddenly realized that his bag contained medical supplies. \u201cRobert?\u201d I choked the question out in disbelief. He just gave me a small smile while he continued his work. \u201cYou mean to tell me that all of these guys\u2026 They\u2019re all your family?\u201d\n\nRobert looked up from where he was examining my jaw with a wry smile, \u201cI told you we don\u2019t forget Mike.\u00a0All the Goodings come to Doe\u2019s who wait. \u201d",

He quickly rolls away but his fianc\u00e9e gets run over and killed.\n\nHe is obviously devastated and swears never to even look at a tractor ever again. So he tears down all his posters and spends all his time in his room, alone and depressed for a few weeks until his mother, again intervenes and gets him to go to the local pub again.\n\nWhen he arrives, the pub is on fire!

It was a trick question.\"\nThe salesman, quickly thinking on his feet, replied that he was sorry the answer was unsatisfactory, but as the Ultimate Computer was precise, perhaps a rewording of the question might work better.\nLittle Johnny thought and said to the Ultimate Computer, \"Where is my mother's husband?\" Again, the hum of the powerful electronic brain filled the room.\nAfter a moment, the screen lit up with an answer: \"Dead. But your father is still fishing in Florida.\"",

I am going to go out and get you a present and it can be anything you want.\"\n\nThe son sat there for a second thinking and said, \"Dad, I really want a pink ping pong ball.\" The dad was rather confused by this but decided to go get his son the ball anyways.\n\nAs he was in line to check out with the ball he thought to himself, \"Nah he doesn't actually want a stupid ping pong ball\" so he went and got him an R/C car instead. The son was the happiest kid in the world and was so excited to get his new toy and gave his dad the biggest hug he could and the dad sat there smiling.\n\nA couple years later when the son took standardized tests in elementary school he got a perfect score on every exam and his dad was the proudest dad in the world and wanted to make sure his son knew it.\n\nHe went up to his son and said, \"Son, I could never be more proud of you.

Top of his class, full ride to whatever school he wanted (Yale for anyone who cares about that detail), graduated with just about every honor you could think of and his dad was the proudest dad in the world and wanted to make sure his son knew it.\n\nHe went up to his son and said, \"Son, I could never be more proud of you.

The dad sat there with a smile on his face as he watched his son drive off.\n\nA couple weeks later, the mom and dad are sitting at the table eating lunch when they receive a troubling phone call. As they heard the call both of their faces started to turn pale, the son was in a terrible crash and was not expected to live through the rest of the day. The two rushed down to the hospital as soon as they could and they hurried to their son's room. When they got there they were happy to see the son was still conscious. The parents rushed to either side of the bed and the dad took his son's hand and looked him in the face and said, \"Son, you have been the best child that anyone could ever ask for and I could never be more proud of you.\"\n\nThe son smiled and said, \"Thanks dad.\"\n\n\"I do have one question for you though.\"\n\nThe son looked up at his old man and said, \"Anything for you Dad.\"\n\n\"Why did you always want that pink ping pong ball?\"\n\nThe son smiled and said, \"Well I always wanted it bec-\"\n\nThen he died.\n",

One cold winter's morning he was walking along a country road, when he heard a cry for help from a nearby lake.\n\nWithout a moment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to a little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for a car to flag down.\n\nCoincidentally the father drives up. \"How can I ever thank you sir?\" he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. \"Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.\"\n\n\"Ah, well...\" stammers the tramp, \"... uh, I'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out.\"\n\n\"Oh dear,\" says the father, \"I don't carry much cash with me, I only have ten pounds - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe.\"\n\n\"No! No!\" says the tramp, \"Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.\"\n\n\"Ten pounds,\" thinks the tramp, \"I'm rich! I'm rich!\" and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.\n\nHe finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. \"I'll have one holiday please!\"\n\n\"Ahem, which holiday would you like?\" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.\n\n\"Oh, any holiday I don't mind, anything up to ten pounds,\" replies the tramp.\n\n\"TEN POUNDS! You'll NEVER get a holiday for ten pounds,\" says the girl incredulously.\n\nShe goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.\n\n\"Well you'll never believe it,\" she says to the tramp, back in the shop. \"I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.\"\n\n\"Yippee!\" exclaims the tramp, \"I'll take it!\"\n\nA few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.\n\n\"Get off my ship ye dirty bum!\" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.\n\n\"But I've got my ticket!\", responds the tramp, \"super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!\"\n\n\"Well okay,\" says the captain, \"but you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.\"\n\nSo the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.\n\n\"Psst,\" says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.\n\n\"Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.\"\n\nThe tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!\n\nFirst they went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets - 6\" pile. A genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.\n\nThen the second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3\" deep, and so on...\n\n3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.\n\n\"Sheer luxury!\" exclaimed the tramp, \"A room of my very own.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you like it,\" replies the captain, \"but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.\"\n\nWell the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...\n\nThen one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.\n\nHe climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...\n\n... and what a dive...!\n\nPerfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.\n\nNow unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.\n\n\"That was amazing!\" exclaimed the captain, \"Where did you learn to dive like that?\"\n\n\"Um, well I've never actually dived before,\" replied the tramp.\n\n\"Well that's incredible!\" says the captain, \"I've never seen...\" He broke off. \"Hey, I've got an idea\", he started again. \"How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!\"\n\n\"It's a deal!\" says our man. For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.\n\nThen one morning the captain comes to talk. \"Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" agreed the tramp.\n\nTwo days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.\n\n\"Well, tramp,\" said the captain, shaking his hand, \"Let's see what you can do.\" And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...\n\nup and up...\n\nbelow him the ship grew smaller...\n\non and on...\n\npast a solitary albatross...\n\nand still higher...\n\ntill the ship was but a speck on the ocean below...\n\nand on still further...\n\ntill the ocean grew dim...\n\nand the earth itself...\n\nbegan to shrink...\n\npast our moon...\n\nand on...\n\nand Mars...\n\nand on...\n\nhigher, and higher...\n\nthrough the asteroid belt...\n\nand on and on towards the diving board...\n\npast the outer planets, until...\n\non the outermost reaches of the Solar System...\n\nhe reached the board.\n\nHe climbed on top and radioed the captain...\n\nand then...\n\nhe jumped.\n\nSlowly at first,\n\nbut speeding up,\n\nfaster, and faster,\n\nspeeding past Pluto,\n\nand the other outer planets,\n\nthrough the asteroid belt,\n\npast Mars,\n\nand the moon,\n\nfaster,\n\nand faster,\n\nfaster - ever faster,\n\nand by now the earth was growing large in the distance, the oceans and land masses grew clear,\n\nfaster, and faster,\n\npast the albatross,\n\ndouble-back somersault,\n\nand he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,\n\nhurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,\n\nDown on the ship the crew strained their necks,\n\n\"I CAN SEE HIM!\" yelled a passenger, \"LOOK!!!\"\n\nThe tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...\n\nNOT A RIPPLE ON THE SURFACE!\n\nDOWN THROUGH THE WATER!\n\nSMASHED THROUGH THE POOL BOTTOM!\n\nDOWN THROUGH THE FIRST DECK!\n\nSMASHING THROUGH THE SECOND!\n\nDOWN!\n\nDOWN!\n\nTHROUGH THE CREW'S QUARTERS!\n\nTHROUGH THE ENGINE ROOMS!\n\nSMASHING THROUGH HIS OWN LITTLE CABIN!\n\nAND DOWN THROUGH THE DOUBLE-STRENGTH STEEL HULL OF THE SHIP!\n\nSTILL DOWN...!\n\nDEEPER,\n\nDEEPER INTO THE MURKY DEPTHS,\n\nTILL.........\n\nSMASH!\n\nInto the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.\n\nDesperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.\n\nUp and up, desperate, gasping...\n\nOut of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.\n\n\"HERO!\" \"WONDERFUL!\" \"AMAZING!\" \"GOOD SHOW THAT!\"\n\nAnd handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.\n\n\"Well tramp, I have NEVER seen anything like that, EVER. That was the most *STUPENDOUS* piece of diving I have ever seen.\"\n\nThe tramp blushed.\n\nThe captain went on, \"but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.\"\n\nAnd the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: \"Well you see...\n\nI'm a just poor tramp...\n\nso you must understand...\n\nI've been through many a hard ship in my life.\"\n",

He is an extensively educated and experienced professional, and I pay him very high wages. He gave me a very different forecast. I trust him and I will continue on my way.\" So they did.\nHowever, a short time later a torrential rain fell from the sky. The King and Queen were totally soaked and their entourage chuckled upon seeing them in such a shameful condition.\n\nFurious, the king returned to the palace and gave the order to execute the weatherman at once! He summoned the farmer and offered him the prestigious and high paying role of royal forecaster.\n\nThe farmer said, \"Your Majesty, I do not know anything about forecasting. I obtain my information from my donkey. If I see his ears drooping, it means with certainty that it will rain.\" So the King hired the donkey on the spot.\n\nAnd thus began the ancient practice of hiring asses to work in government and occupy its highest and most influential positions..",

It looks empty so he opens the door to explore inside. \"Hello\", a voice greets him from a dark corner. \"I am so sorry! I thought it was abandoned. I'll leave now.\" he replies,  shocked that someone could live here. \"No, no,  please stay a moment. I haven't had company in years.\" the elderly woman says, with a smile. \"Yeah, I guess I can stay, I don't have anywhere else to be.\" the boy says, returning the smile.

I had a good time\" the young man says to his new friend. \"I am the one who is truly grateful. Please take these as a gift for your time.\" she hands him a pair of ugly, colorful, but clean, socks. \"Thank you?\" he says, confused. \"I can't help you make friends with people your own age but these socks may give you some courage to open up more.\" says the grateful woman. They spend time together at least weekly, and their friendship grows, but the socks remain unused in a drawer. One morning teenage boy has no clean white socks and in a rush to catch the bus put the socks given to him by his elderly friend. When he arrives to school everyone he passes smiles and greets him. \"Odd\", he thinks. At lunch, the popular kids ask him to sit at their table. Before the end of the lunch hour the prettiest cheerleader in school is kissing his cheek. When he gets home he tosses all his other socks out and puts his lucky ones in the wash. The next morning he puts on his socks and gets on the bus. When he gets back to school everything is back to terrible. He is ignored or bullied all day and anxiously awaits the final bell so he can speak to the old woman and get the socks fixed. When he enters her house he sees a massive bear mauling and eating his friend. \"STOP!!! \" He yells. \"I need her help!!

He walks up the four flights of stairs, thinking about how lucky he is to see his wife and drink a cold beer. He reaches his door but finds it locked. He knocks, and as he leans in he hears his wife moaning, along with the sounds of some guy. Well, he goes red with rage and starts pounding on the door. After a minute his wife opens the door, a blanket wrapped around her naked body. \"It's not what you think!\" she screams, but he ignores her, pushing past to see if he can find the guy. The apartment is only one room, with a bathroom off to the side, so there's not a lot of places to hide. The husband looks under the bed, peeks into the shower, but can't find the guy. Then he notices the window is open. He runs over, looks out, and sees a guy in his shorts hanging from the window below him. The husband starts yelling, \"I'll kill you!\", pulling tools off his belt and throwing them at the guy, until the guy suddenly loses his grip and falls. But since the fall is only three stories, when he lands he only breaks his legs. The husband is furious. He looks around for something to throw, and the closest and biggest thing he finds is the fridge. He pulls it to the window and then pushes it out, and it falls right on the guy, killing him instantly. However, in doing this, the husband works himself up so much he has a heart attack and also dies. \n\n\nThe next thing he knows the husband is standing in line at the pearly gates. Saint Peter beckons him forward and asks, \"Well my son, how did you die?\"\n\n\"Well,\" replies the husband \" I came home from a hard day at work and found my wife cheating on me. I was so angry that when I found the guy hanging outside the window I threw things at him until he fell. However, he only broke his legs, and I wasn't satisfied, so instead I grabbed the fridge and pushed it out onto him. But in doing this, I had a heart attack, and here I am.\"\n\n\"Oh boy.\" Replied Saint Peter \"Well, while I'm sad that your wife was not true, it is wrong to kill. I'm afraid you have to go to hell.\" With that, the husband is ushered off to hell. \n\nSaint Peter looks at the next man in line and beckons him forward. \"And how did you die, my son?\"\n\nThe guy looks perplexed. \"It was the strangest thing, sir. I was sitting at home trying to work out, but my apartment is so small I have to be creative and do pull ups outside my window.

He would unload all the cookies and make the three-day-long drive back to the factory. He'd been working at the company for years, and was quite reputable.\n\nOne day, he loaded up his trailer and hit the road. After driving for hours, he stopped at a truck stop and inspected his cargo as he normally would, just to make sure everything's okay. When he opened up the doors, there was a hole in one of the packages! He looked around the trailer and his eyes landed on a cookie, walking around the boxes! The driver couldn't believe it, but grabbed the cookie, stuffed it back in the box and taped it shut. \"That should take care of it,\" he thought. After getting a cup of coffee, he started driving again. \n\nWhen he stopped for the night, the driver thought that he better check and make sure that cookie wasn't out of the box again. He opened the doors again, saw the broken box and a cookie doing the Charleston! The driver thought he was going insane, but there it was; a dancing cookie. He brought out the duct tape and sealed the cookie back in the box, then went to bed.\n\nThe next morning, the truck driver woke up a the crack of dawn, thinking that last night's events were only a dream. After getting a bagel and coffee from a restaurant, he started up his truck and hit the road, jamming to the radio. Once he was fully awake, he remembered the cookie and realized it wasn't a dream. Slamming on the brakes, he took the nearest off ramp from the highway, swung the trailer doors open. Lo and behold, the cookie box had a new hole in it, and the cookie was leading a one cookie conga line on top! Furious, the driver snatched the cookie up, crammed it into the box, and covered the entire box in tape. Pleased that he wouldn't have to worry about the cookie again, he kept driving until the sun went down.\n\nOn the third day, after a peaceful night's sleep, the truck driver started on the last leg of the journey to the buyer. He didn't even check the trailer for the cookie, being sure that it couldn't get through the tape. \n\nWhen he finally arrived at his destination, the driver checked in at the office and backed his truck up to the loading dock. As the unloading staff opened the doors, a small brown object fell out of a box. They didn't notice anything until they had unloaded a few boxes; one of the boxes was covered in tape and had a hole in it! Thinking it may have been caused by mice, they called over their supervisor. After taking one look, the supervisor called the driver's company, explained what happened, hung up and spoke two small words to the driver:\n\n\"You're fired.\"\n\nDevastated, the driver didn't know what to do. He grabbed the offending box and stepped back into his eighteen-wheeler and sat there for a minute, in shock. Something caught his eye on the dashboard. It was the cookie, doing the moonwalk. The driver didn't make an effort to put the cookie back into the box, it didn't matter any more.\n\nHe drove to the beach, took the box of cookies, and sat at the end of a pier with the cookie next to him, tap dancing. \"I hope you're happy,\" he said to the cookie. \"You got me fired from a job I worked at for years, a job I was happy doing. Now what am I supposed to do?\" The cookie didn't look at him and kept dancing. The driver became madder and madder. \"You think that's funny? How about THIS?!\" He hollered as he kicked the cookie box and cookie off the dock into the ocean.\n\n**THE** **END**\n\nIsn't that a crumby ending?",

He ran down the stairs and flung the door open and bolted down the road toward the playground. Just as he crossed the road his face beaming, oblivious to the oncoming traffic, a bus tried to swerve and miss him but it was to late. The boy was crushed by the bus from the neck down, only his head remained. \n\nThe moral of the story is that in life it is better to stay ahead.",

He says to the man, \"if you can climb into the tower and ring the bell, the position is yours.\"  \n\nElated, the armless man runs up the tower stairs, bypassing the rope that one would normally use, but that he was unable to manipulate.  At the top of the stairs, there was ladder to get into the belfry.  Without hesitation, he climbs the ladder using his teeth, and beams as he looks upon the church's bell.  He backs into the corner of the belfry, takes a deep breath, and runs at the bell full speed.  He slams into the bell, it swings and tolls beautifully.   The bishop kept his word and awarded the man the job.\n\nWeeks go by, and all seems right with the world.  The armless man enjoys his new life, but sometimes, he gets a little dizzy tolling the higher hours.  One day, while performing his duty to mark noon, he misses the bell altogether and sails out the far side of the tower.  He falls to his death, and a crowd gathers around the body.  In the general murmur, a voice calls out, \"does anyone know this man?\"  Another replies...\n\n\"No, but his face sure rings a bell!\"\n\nWith a heavy heart, the bishop places out the sign once more, advertising the open position.  Again, weeks pass without a single taker, until another man arrives.  His resemblance to the previous man is uncanny.  A hunched back, no arms, and nearly identical in appearance.  The bishop is dubious, fearful of a repeat of the recent tragedy, but the man falls to his knees, weeping and pleading, and against his better judgement, the bishop makes him the same offer.  The hunchback climbs into the belfry, backs into the corner, runs and tolls the bell, claiming the job.\n\nTo ensure the new ringer's safety, the bishop commissions the installation of bars across the open sides of the tower, and life continues on.  Over the next few years, the hunchback enjoys his life within the cathedral.   He is well cared for, and happy to perform his duty, though the midday ringings do tend to take their toll, and like his predecessor, he misses once in a while, but the bars give him security.  Unfortunately, the bars are not maintained, they rust, and at last, they give.  The armless man tumbles out of the tower and falls to his death.  Once more, a crowd gathers, and again, someone calls out, \"does anyone know this man?\"  And a voice replies...\n\n\"No, but he sure is a dead ringer for his brother!\"",

So he does as instructed, going through the door to the right and down the hall to the left and there's Sister Agnes, who says, \"Yes, that will be $50 please and just take this door to the right.\"  He pays his money and takes the door to the right, where he finds himself back out in the parking lot with a big sign that says, \"Thank you, you've just been screwed by the Sisters of Mercy.\"",

So Noah, being a wise old Noah, decided to set up a designated shitting area at the bow of the ark. He then called the animals in for a meeting. He proceeded to tell them about the newly designated shitting area. After the 20th day there was so much shit gathered at the bow that the ark began to tilt, leaving the stern raised making it near impossible to play pool. So, being a wise old Noah, he once again had a plan. With the help of the big animals such as the elephants and rhino's he rolled up all the shit into one huge ball and threw it overboard into the ocean.... \n\n325,000 years later Christopher Columbus discovered it.",

        "body": "An ageing prison facility is constantly beset by long queues for the shower area, which the managers decide to do something about because having all the prisoners together in one area outside of their cells might get nasty. So they look into the problem, and realise that, although the showers themselves are fast enough, the prisoners actually spend a suspiciously long amount of time drying themselves - causing another possible security threat. The managers then hit on the idea of installing a sort of drying cubicle next to the shower, where each prisoner would enter, be assailed by strong blasts of air from all directions, and be fully dry within half a minute, thus leaving them with no excuse to loiter in the shower.\n\nSo they install these drying boxes for the prisoners, and at first they seem to be a great success. However, although the machines worked, they were so powerful that they caused a lot of noise, even from outside of the boxes, and - this is important - the noise could be heard in the managers' offices. So the managers decided to find another solution, and remove the drying machines, because they couldn't do any work with that cacophony happening every evening.\n\nWhen the technician eventually arrives at the prison to remove the machines, he seems rather reluctant for some reason, but the managers insist he does the deed. However, the moment they are disconnected, there's a massive electricity failure throughout the entire complex, leading to all the prisoners escaping due to lack of electric security systems.\n\nOf course, the managers are outraged, and start shouting at the technician: \"What the hell did you do? I told you to remove those damn drying boxes, not let all the inmates escape!\"\n\nThe technician says, calmly, \"I thought you knew what would happen if those drying machines were removed...\"\n\nThis does nothing to assuage the managers' anger, and they keep demanding an explanation as to why they should have know that there would be a power cut. After several minutes of argument, they finally get one.\n\n\"Don't you remember?\", says the technician. \"The mighty con drier is the powerhouse of the cell...\"",
